## Books and video games

I’ve finished over ~~215~~ [225 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/54484570) (mostly manga) this year but started slowing down now that I’ve run out of stuff to read. I haven’t played much recently besides Zenless Zone Zero, so ~~I’ll grab Silent Hill 2 next week~~ (Done!). I never finished the original game but enjoyed the Resident Evil remakes, which many are comparing it to. I’m excited.
