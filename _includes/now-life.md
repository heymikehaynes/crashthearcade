* I recently switched my WordPress site back and forth from Ghost to Tumblr and back again before finally settling on Eleventy. Iâ€™ve been enjoying learning something new, and the community is excellent.
* At the beginning of November, I'm heading to Vancouver for a work related trip. I don't typically travel well so we'll see how that goes but I am excited to meet up with my team for the first time.
