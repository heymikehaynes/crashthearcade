I feel that so much of the existing infrastructure and tools of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) have been built without the input of people dedicated to crafting an experience for a broader range of users. I won’t call out specific services, products, or people, I mean no disrespect, but it’s clear that so many of the tools that are available are made by developers, for developers.

If people really want the independent web to take off, to achieve anything close to mass-adoption, more consideration needs to placed into how non-developers can get started with them.
