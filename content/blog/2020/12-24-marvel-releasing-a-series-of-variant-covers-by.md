[Joe Grunenwald for The Beat](https://www.comicsbeat.com/michael-cho-marvel-comics-march-covers/):

> Marvel Comics has announced a new series of variant covers for their March-shipping titles featuring the striking artwork of Michael Cho. The covers will feature iconic versions of Marvel characters rendered by Cho in his signature duo-tone style.

Like Cho’s first run of covers, these look *incredible*. I’ve been a huge fan of his work for years now as the result is always beautiful and truly timeless, much like that of Darwyn Cooke and Bruce Timm.
