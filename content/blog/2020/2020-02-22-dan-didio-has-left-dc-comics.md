[Gregory Lawrence for Collider](https://collider.com/dan-didio-dc-comics-exit/):

> DiDio was instrumental in many of DC’s contemporary shifts and successes, including The New 52, a 2011 revamp of all of DC’s continuity post-Flashpoint that saw every DC title restarting at issue #1. DiDio also became a fan-favorite figure, serving as DC’s front-facing de facto spokesperson at fan events and conventions. In an era where most of “comic book success” is found in movies and TV, DiDio made sure the actual ink-and-paper (or digital) comic books had a home and focus in the business strategies of DC.

I had the pleasure of meeting Dan DiDio at FanExpo in Toronto a number of years ago. He is one of the nicest, most down-to-earth people in comics I’ve ever met. I specifically remember him coming out from inside the DC booth at the event to chat in the aisle with my friends and I about what the company had planned (pre-Flashpoint) and his time working on [ReBoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReBoot) in the 90s.
