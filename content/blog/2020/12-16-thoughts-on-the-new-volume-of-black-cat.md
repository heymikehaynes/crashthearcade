It dawned on me yesterday when I got my weekly pull list email that the new Black Cat series is spinning out of the King in Black event, which I’m not reading. Titles that start new volumes requiring you to be current on the latest big event is something more books have done lately and I really dislike it.

The fifth volume of [Spider-Woman](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Spider-Woman_Vol_5_1) did the same thing during the Spider-verse event and I was immediately discouraged from reading beyond the first couple issues. I’m hoping the same doesn’t happen with this new volume of Black Cat.

These characters and stories can and should be allowed to stand on their own. In my opinion, starting the book as a spin-off feels like it’s being set up to fail in the long run.
