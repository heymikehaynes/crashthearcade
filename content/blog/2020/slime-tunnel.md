Slime Tunnel is visually harsh, in a good way, and reads quickly. That said, if you’re anything like me, it’ll stay with you for a while after you’re finished reading.

Personally, I love horror stories like this. Books where there’s nothing immediately *scary* but the entire experience is unsettling and eerie, which I don’t find in a lot of horror comics but is certainly the case here. Writer/artist Gavin Fullerton has another comic on his personal site called [Strand](http://gavinfullerton.com/strand) that has a similar vibe.

You can pay any amount you’d like to own a copy of Slime Tunnel and I’d encourage you to help support these sorts of projects in some way.
