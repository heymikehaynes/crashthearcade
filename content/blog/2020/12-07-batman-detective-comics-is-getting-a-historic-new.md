> Of late, she has also steadily notched her belt with solid, award-winning work for Marvel and DC Comics, including runs of X-23 and Hulk, Harley Quinn: Breaking Glass, and lately, Wonder Woman.

I stopped reading Detective Comics years ago when the book was, in my opinion, spinning its wheels post-Rebirth. Based on this news, it sounds like it might be time to take another peek.
