This was a year of *change*. I leaned really hard into console gaming this year, specifically Xbox, after being pretty focused on PC and tried playing a handful of games on mobile too. Here are my favourites from a variety of categories.

## Game of the year

Alan Wake II. I love what Remedy is doing with their connected universe and can’t wait to see where they go in the Night Springs and Lake House DLC.

## Best DLC

Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty added so much to the vanilla Cyberpunk experience and totally flipped the theme of the original game on its head.

## Best remake

Dead Space was really good but I’ve got to hand it to Nintendo for Super Mario RPG. The nostalgia in that one hits *real* hard.

## Game I need more time with

This one’s a toss up between Sea of Stars, which I loved but dove into on a whim just before a bunch of other games came out. Also, Baldur’s Gate 3, which was only released on Xbox at the beginning of December.

## Weirdest game

Wanted: Dead. Seriously, what the fuck?

## Most anticipated game

I think I’m equally excited to see where Square goes with Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and I can’t resist anything by HoYoverse so Zenless Zone Zero is up there too. I also can’t wait for Dragon’s Dogma II. I can’t explain why but the original is a favourite of mine.
