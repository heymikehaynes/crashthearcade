I read [Terence’s post](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2022/12/the-ethics-of-syndicating-comments-using-webmentions/) about webmentions and thought I’d toss in my two cents. I removed webmentions, [brid.gy](http://brid.gy/), and any ActivityPub functionality a few months ago for a few reasons.

It occurred to me, before the internet had [a bit of a meltdown](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/14/bluesky-and-mastodon-users-are-having-a-fight-that-could-shape-the-next-generation-of-social-media/) over something similar, that some people wouldn’t want their replies on my website. It’s a permanent copy that they have no access to, can’t edit, and might not even know *exists*. As someone replying to a toot or [skeet](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/skeet-bluesky-slang)(?), I’m not sure it’s something I’d opt into if I had the option. I often edit and delete things. So, it bothers me that I can’t update something I’ve said without writing another reply.

Why then would I put others in that situation?

I also thought about the value of it all. Who was this benefiting? Were readers finding the discussions across various networks useful when reading the things I posted? If they weren’t, I was doing this for myself. At that point, given many valid concerns people have about when and where their comments appear, it wasn’t a good enough reason to keep doing it.

Lastly, I questioned if was I dragging people into a mess of conversation where, depending how far these mentions went, they become part of a discussion on a site they didn’t often visit. One where they couldn’t reply or discuss their opinion in greater detail. That didn’t seem fair.

I see the value of keeping records of conversations. We can interact with readers on our own websites, on our own terms. But, in the end, the answers to these questions made it clear that the cons outweighed the pros.

In the end, I decided to shut it all off.

I want to be clear that I’m not trying to shame anyone who decides to enable webmentions. If the answers to anything above are different for you, it may make sense to take a different approach. Just consider some of these outcomes and the ones raised in Terence’s post before you go down that road.

I misspoke about what aspects of webmentions I was turning off for my site. I should have been more specific that it was the syndication of comments and reactions across sites, not webmentions as a whole.
