Much has been said of the empty husk masquerading as a new version of the much-beloved Waypoint, but I think <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/i-still-dont-understand-why-until-dawn-needed-a-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a> in particular is as perfect of an example of why bringing the site back is a bad idea.

The article, written by Dwayne Jenkins about the Until Dawn remake, is framed around a fundamental misunderstanding by the author of the development of the game. Jenkins speculates on what the remake implies for Supermassive Games, but Supermassive didn’t work on the remake, Ballistic Moon did.

I'm not sure if you could draw a clearer parallel to the people who decided to bring the site back in the first had a similar misunderstanding of what made the original great in the first place.
