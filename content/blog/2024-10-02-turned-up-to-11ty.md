Just a quick update today: I’ve rebuilt my site using [11ty](https://11ty.dev). Sorry in advance if you’re seeing duplicate entries in your RSS reader.

Over the years, I’ve tried building *something* with 11ty a couple of times, but I always hit a roadblock and quickly switched back to Jekyll, WordPress, or something else I was more familiar with. This time, maybe inspired by the [recent drama](https://crashthearcade.com/blog/2024-09-28-thoughts-wordpress-drama/) in the WordPress community, I pushed through and made a thing! I even encountered a few build errors along the way, but I managed to fix them!

On the more technical side, another positive aspect of the site is that it's made of a few of my Reeder feeds, for example, the [Bookmarks](/bookmarks) page. After fetching the feeds, it uses a web hook to periodically rebuild the site and ensure its up-to-date. This is great since I’ve been moving more and more of the content I follow and read into the app.

I'm going to be exploring CMS capabilities at some point with [CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com/) but, for now, I'm pretty happy with what I've built.
