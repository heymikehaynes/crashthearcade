I found [WWDC24](https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2024/06/wwdc24-highlights/) to be a bit of a mixed bag.

I’m excited for the quality of life updates across Mac and iPhone, including the new Passwords app, updates to Mail, and the continuity stuff from the phone to the computer. I’m also interested but cautious about some of the intelligence stuff Apple showed off.

I’m terribly disorganized when it comes to the things on my phone and computers (ex: I have documents spread across 3-4 different apps) so having a more personalized (and private) “assistant” on my phone could be really beneficial. I like the ability to teach Siri how to use apps to automate repetitive tasks, sort of like what Rabbit was promising for the R1. Lastly, our household uses Siri a lot via the HomePod in our living area so the improvements there will be nice.

On the flip side, the image generation stuff looked awful and the whole idea felt very un-Apple to me. I honestly believe the presentation would have been better received without any of that included. I think it’s also a shame to see these sorts of features announced without any mention of how this impacts Apple’s environmental efforts.

Above all, it’s nice to see that Apple will be rolling this out in stages, as a beta, rather than forcing all sorts of half baked AI “updates” like we’ve seen from Microsoft and Google.
