[Benjamin Blum for CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nhl-backtracks-pride-tape-ban-1.7006393?cmp=rss):

> The National Hockey League is ending its ban on players supporting social causes on their equipment, including a popular stick tape in support of the LGBTQ community, the league announced on Tuesday.

Itâ€™s great to see this get rolled back, obviously, but Bettman, Daly, and the rest of them should be absolutely ashamed of themselves that this happened at all.
