[Adam Smith for Rock Paper Shotgun](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/06/13/prey-arkane-e3/):

> Just as DOOM is not Doom 4, Prey is no longer Prey 2. That makes sense, given that it doesn’t appear to be a sequel to its ten year old predecessor in any way. The only real similarity appears to be in the basics of the setup – there are aliens and they want to kill you.

While I’m interested to see what comes of this new game, this announcement disappointed me a little. The game (what little we saw) that was [shown](https://youtu.be/BVCfo6CLkb0) five years ago seems to have all but vanished. In its place, a game that closely resembles a cross between Dead Space and Deus Ex.

> In Prey, you awaken aboard Talos I, a space station orbiting the moon in the year 2032. You are the key subject of an experiment meant to alter humanity forever – but things have gone terribly wrong. The space station has been overrun by hostile aliens and you are now being hunted. As you dig into the dark secrets of Talos I and your own past, you must survive using the tools found on the station, your wits, weapons, and mind-bending abilities.

The game hardly sounds bad, and Arkane’s last game, Dishonored, was fantastic. There was just something about that first teaser that really had me intrigued, like something out of The Twilight Zone. This new game just feels a little too familiar. We don’t have much to go on yet, so I’m hoping that elements from that first teaser trailer are kept in some way or form.
