[Patrick O’Rourke for MobileSyrup](https://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/24/pebble-launches-kickstarter-for-pebble-time-2-pebble-2-and-pebble-core-canada/):

> With the help of crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, Pebble has revealed plans to launch three new products, the Pebble Time 2, Pebble 2 and Pebble Core.
> 
>  The most interesting of the three devices is the Pebble Core, a 3G connected wearable Pebble says is designed to allow runners to track their fitness without carrying a smartphone. The Pebble 2 and Pebble Time 2 are “fitness-focused smartwatches” according to Pebble, and both devices are set to feature built-in heart rate monitors.

The watches themselves look like standard fare but, as O’Rourke mentions in the piece above, the Core looks to be the most interesting piece of this puzzle. I’m curious to see not only how well that sells but also what sorts of interesting things the hacker community will come up with.

My issue with this whole thing is how much Pebble seems to be abusing the infrastructure of Kickstarter. I’ve always felt that it was the place for people or businesses with limited resources that wanted to bring projects to life, like what Pebble did with their [original](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android) smartwatch. Kickstarter itself says this on their site:

> Kickstarter helps artists, musicians, filmmakers, designers, and other creators find the resources and support they need to make their ideas a reality.

Pebble’s last [campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-time-awesome-smartwatch-no-compromises), the second of three, brought them $20 million. At that point, I’d say they have the resources they need. Once again turning to Kickstarter to fund their project doesn’t help quell the rumours of the company’s decline, if anything, it makes me think there’s more to it than we first heard about.

Having pledged for the Pebble Time and been disappointed with the finished watch, I’m definitely passing on these new Pebbles. The new project has already greatly surpassed the amount they were looking for so backers can rest assured that they’ll be receiving their updated hardware. I guess you could always wait it out if you’re unsure, something tells me Best Buy will be carrying them.
