[Nick Salerni for iPhone in Canada](https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/new-leaked-images-show-black-version-of-5-5-inch-iphone-7/):

> The black colour on the iPhone looks incredibly stylish, complete with little details like the shade of the antenna bands. Another thing we can clearly see is the absence of a 3.5mm jack on the bottom of the unit and a total of two speakers.

My concern here is the “S” badge that appears on the back of the device. This goes counter to almost every report and doesn’t add up with Apple’s naming structure at all. That said, this looks really sharp. I’m really hoping that we end up with this colour option when the phone is presumably announced sometime in September.
