[Meagan Damore for CBR](http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/sonys-venom-taps-writer-for-new-film-potential-franchise):

> “Venom” is swinging back to Sony. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the studio has hired Dante Harper to write the script for the “Spider-Man” spinoff, which is intended to develop into its own franchise.

I’m not usually one to hold a grudge but given how much I disliked not only Spider-Man 3, in which Venom made his first movie appearance, but also Sony’s most recent outing in Amazing Spider-Man 2, I’m certainly not holding my breath for a single Spider-Man related movie of theirs to be competent, let alone a franchise.
