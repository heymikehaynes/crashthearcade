[Richard Gao for Android Police](https://www.androidpolice.com/2016/09/01/lolwut/):

> Turing is calling this new “perfectly designed device” the Turing Phone Cadenza, and they’re expecting to release it next year. Some purported specs include two Snapdragon 830s (yes, not one, but two processors that haven’t even been announced), a 60MP “iMAX 6K Quad Rear Camera, Triplet Lens/T1.2” (???), a 20MP dual front camera, 12GB of DDR4X RAM (just… why?), 512GB of internal storage with two microSD slots, a 100Wh battery with graphene and hydrogen fuel cells (lolwut), and the ability to simultaneously read four nanoSIMs. I have no words.

Who is this for? No smartphone user needs this.
