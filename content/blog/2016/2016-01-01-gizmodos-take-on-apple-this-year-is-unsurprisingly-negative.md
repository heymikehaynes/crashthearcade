[Mario Aguilar for Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/everything-apple-introduced-this-year-kinda-sucked-1749308570):

> In 2015, Apple made a series of flashy new introductions of both hardware and software. Several seemed amazing at first, but on closer inspection, they were all disappointing. Here is the year in Apple things that sucked.

Leave it to the wordsmiths at Gizmodo to end this year with a *thud*. Conveniently, they don’t hold every other tech company to such ridiculously high standards or ensure that their writers take a minute to consider if something they’re putting together might be better suited for their personal blog instead of the front page of a news site.

Alternatively, 9to5Mac has a worthwhile [retrospective](http://9to5mac.com/2015/12/31/opinion-apple-good-year-product-launches-2015-despite-unrealistic-expectations/) on Apple’s 2015.
