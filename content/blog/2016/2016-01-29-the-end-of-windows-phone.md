[Tom Warren for The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/28/10864034/windows-phone-is-dead):

> Windows Phone started off life as a promising alternative to Android and iOS five years ago. Microsoft positioned its range of Windows Phone 7 handsets as the true third mobile ecosystem, but it’s time to admit it has failed.

It’s a shame to see, really. I was really interested in the [Lumia 950 XL](https://www.gsmarena.com/microsoft_lumia_950_xl-7263.php) at one point before ultimately deciding on my current Android phone. In a world where Google releases new Nexus devices every year to great fanfare from Android die-hards but little recognition otherwise, Windows phone could continue to exist in some form.
