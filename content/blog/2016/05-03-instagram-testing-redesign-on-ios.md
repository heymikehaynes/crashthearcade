[Chance Miller for 9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2016/04/26/instagram-redesign-monochromatic/):

> Instagram, following the controversial announcement that it would change the order in which images appear in user feeds, now appears to be testing a complete redesign of its app.

I really like the direction they’re (potentially) going with this. Flushing the colour out of the app UI and really letting the pictures come to life and take centre stage. I haven’t always been the biggest fan of Instagram but it’s thoughtful, smart updates like this, rather than a couple new filters every few months, that would make me actually start using it again on a regular basis.

Who knows, maybe we’ll finally get a new iOS icon out of this too.
