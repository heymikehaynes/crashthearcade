[Zac Hall for 9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2016/07/27/pocket-casts-6-update/):

> Pocket Casts is a cross-platform podcast player with apps on iOS, Android, the web, and even Windows Phone, and today Shifty Jelly released a major update to the iPhone and iPad version. Pocket Casts 6 is out today and includes loads of changes including a refreshed user interface, a dark theme, multitasking features on iPad including Picture-in-Picture and Split View, and much more.

Pocket Casts has been my go-to podcast player for a while now and while it always got the job done, the UI left much to be desired, specifically on iOS. The new app, built in Swift, doesn’t reinvent the wheel but does bring a much cleaner, modern, more comfortable look to the app. Rows are given greater margins, the app typeface has been switched and, as mentioned, they’ve included a dark mode option, which looks great.
