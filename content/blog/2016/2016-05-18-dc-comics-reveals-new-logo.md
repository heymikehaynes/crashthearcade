[Meagan Damore for CBR](https://www.cbr.com/dc-comics-unveils-new-logo-for-rebirth-beyond/):

> Following its debut on “Rebirth,” the logo — which was developed in partnership with Pentagram — will begin to appear on various digital platforms, including DC websites, social media channels, the DC All Access webseries and the DC All Access app. It shows many similarities to [earlier DC Comics logos](http://blog.signalnoise.com/2012/01/14/thoughts-on-the-new-dc-comics-logo/), particularly the one introduced in 1972.

Initially, I liked this new look but the more I see it, the more it feels overly generic and unfinished. I’m hoping it comes across better on the covers of the books when it debuts during Rebirth because, currently, DC’s use of the logo on [their social media accounts](https://twitter.com/dccomics) isn’t particularly flattering. Not to mention how strange it is to see DC ushering in a new identity so soon after the last one.

There are some alternative [designs](https://twitter.com/Cap_White/status/732762975258435585) fans have come up with worth checking out and designer Khoi Vinh has a great [analysis](https://www.subtraction.com/2016/05/18/yet-another-new-dc-comics-logo/) of the logo and summarizes it far better than I ever could.
