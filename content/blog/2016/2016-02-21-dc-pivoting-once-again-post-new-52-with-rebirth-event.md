[Chris Arrant for Newsarama](http://web.archive.org/web/20170503042515/http://www.newsarama.com/28043-johns-leads-dc-s-linewide-relaunch-with-dc-universe-rebirth.html):

> “The whole point of ‘Rebirth,’ for all of us, is to get back to the essence of the characters,” Johns said. “In the DC Universe: Rebirth special, the very first couple lines in it sum up what this is to me. There’s a picture of the world, and the mysterious narrator says, ‘I love this world, but there’s something missing.’”
> 
>  As expected, DC’s “Rebirth” takes cues from Johns’ previous miniseries Flash: Rebirth and Green Lantern: Rebirth, but applied to the entirety of the DCU.

Good on Geoff Johns to really get behind this whole initiative and make it happen. Obviously he’s not the only one involved but this just shows he continues to be the heart and soul of DC.

> Johns will also be working directly with the creative teams of every book DC is publishing for “Rebirth.”

Reading stuff like this, it’s great to see them listening to fans, retailers, and their creative teams to ensure this new direction works for everyone. While the New 52 seemed like a bit of a PR stunt, getting everyone in on this new project looks like a better plan for the longterm success of DC and comics as a whole.

> As part of this ‘Rebirth,’ all of DC’s titles after May 24’s DC Universe: Rebirth will be relaunched with new #1 issues. The two exceptions are Action Comics and Detective Comics, which will revert back to their historical number of #957 and #934, respectively.

As a sidenote, I’m really happy to see Action and Detective returning to their original numbering. It just never felt right to see them starting over, despite whatever intimidation new readers might feel seeing books above issue 900 on the shelves.
