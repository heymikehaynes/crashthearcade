[Ron Amadeo for Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/02/google-display-ads-to-switch-to-100-html-will-ban-flash-in-2017/):

> On the Adwords Google+ page, Google just announced a timeline for banishing Flash from its advertising network, announcing that â€œGoogle Display Network and DoubleClick Digital Marketing are now going 100% HTML5.

Thank goodness. This cannot possibly happen soon enough.
