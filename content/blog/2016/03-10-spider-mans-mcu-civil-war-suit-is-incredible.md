[Chris Plante for The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/10/11194196/spider-man-suit-captain-america-civil-war-trailer):

> Spider-Man just leapt into the final shot of the Captain America: Civil War trailer, tingling spidey-senses across social media. The clip lasts only a couple seconds, but gives fans their first clear look at the web-slingerâ€™s new suit. Marvel could not have designed a more nostalgic look.

The suit, which looks pretty incredible, seems to blend the classic Steve Ditko look of the 60s with some of the elements seen in the newer Spidey stories, like Ends of the Earth arc from a few years ago. I get goosebumps when I see the eyes moving in the trailer. I love it.
