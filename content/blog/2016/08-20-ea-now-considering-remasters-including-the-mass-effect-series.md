[Mike Futter for Game Informer](https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2016/08/16/ea-strongly-hints-that-mass-effect-games-will-get-remastered.aspx):

> In our conversation at EA’s Gamescom welcome event, Soderlund stopped short of confirming the remasters are coming, but he strongly hinted that they might be in the offing when we asked about BioWare’s sci-fi trilogy specifically.

I’ve always found it strange that EA didn’t explore this avenue at all, what with almost every other game company tossing recycled versions of their games onto store shelves. It seems to run completely counter to the previous “business first, fun second” model EA followed only a handful of years ago, given the cost in updating many older titles is lower, compared to developing an entirely new game, and can offer a pretty large return.

That said, it’s nice to see them really take their time on this and not exploit the fans in any way. I’ve always insisted that this pattern of just rereleasing games isn’t particularly healthy for the industry… but if you hand me a remastered copy of the Mass Effect Trilogy on PS4, i’ll hand you whatever amount of money you want, just please make it happen.
