[Rich Johnston for Bleeding Cool](http://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/02/18/tom-king-leaves-the-vision-with-12):

> It is very possibly the best comic book Marvel Comics is publishing. But Tom King is a new DC Comics exclusive writer. We think he will be writing the Batman bi-weekly comic launching with Rebirth.

It’s a shame to hear the book’s coming to an end but I’m happy the creative team will be able to tell the story they sent out to tell from the beginning. The Vision has has been a real breath of fresh air and, as the linked article mentions, is one of the best books going at Marvel right now.
