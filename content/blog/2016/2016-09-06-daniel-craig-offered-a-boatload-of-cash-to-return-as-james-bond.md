[Jesse Gormley for CBR](http://www.cbr.com/rumor-daniel-craig-offered-150m-to-return-as-james-bond/):

> James Bond himself, Daniel Craig, is rumored to have been offered an astounding $150 million, by Sony, to return as 007 for two more films, according to [Radaronline](http://radaronline.com/celebrity-news/sony-offers-daniel-craig-millions-two-more-james-bond-films/).

>  It’s been widely noted online, though, that Craig, 48, has expressed little interest in returning to the iconic role. But, with Sony still in the vetting process for the next Bond, the company is looking to secure Craig until the process is complete.

While I understand the idea of transitioning both the character and the audience into a new actor, would anyone really want to see Craig come back for two movies if his heart isn’t in the role at all? During parts of Spectre it was pretty clear that, for Craig, the magic was gone.
