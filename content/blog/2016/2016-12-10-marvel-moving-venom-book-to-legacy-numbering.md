[Brett White for CBR](https://www.cbr.com/marvel-teases-venom-150-with-adam-kubert-art/):

> May 2017’s issue of “Venom” will be numbered #150, a number taking into account all of the previous issues of “Venom” published across previous volumes.

I wish Marvel would figure out if they want to continue legacy numbering of books or not. This is a chore to keep up with and makes it really hard to recommend books to new readers.
