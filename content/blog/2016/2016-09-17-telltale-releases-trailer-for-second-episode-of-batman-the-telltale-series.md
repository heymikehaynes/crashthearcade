[Davey Nieves for The Beat](https://www.comicsbeat.com/telltale-releases-intense-trailer-for-batman-episode-2-children-of-arkham/):

> Last month Telltale Games made a huge splash with the debut of their new Batman inspired series. It was a ballsy shake up of the established Dark Knight mythos while still retaining the essence of what makes the character great. Today the studio unveil the gripping new trailer for BATMAN – The Telltale Series – Episode 2: Children of Arkham.

I played through the first episode right after release in August and loved it. I might even go so far as to say it’s the best game Telltale has made so far, including the original [Walking Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(video_game)), but we’ll have to wait to see how it all wraps up. They’ve more than lived up to the legacy of Batman and have been able to put their own spin on the world too.
