[Samit Sarkar for Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/6/12106196/the-witcher-3-game-of-the-year-edition):

> The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt developer CD Projekt Red is planning to release a Game of the Year Edition of the open-world action game, the studio confirmed today in a statement to Polygon.

A great value for an amazing game. Without question, the best game I played last year and — counting the Blood &amp; Wine DLC — probably this year too.

Ironically, this news comes from Polygon of all places, which did not include The Witcher 3 in their Games of the Year [list](http://www.polygon.com/a/game-of-the-year-2015) for 2015.
