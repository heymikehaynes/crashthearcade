[Mark Linsangan for The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/13/12465362/twitter-night-mode-iphone-apple-ios):

> Last month, Twitter added a night mode for Android users, hoping that it would drive people to use the app and boost its flagging user-base. The update wasn’t extended to iOS users, who were left it in the dark (no pun intended). Now, it looks like Twitter might finally be adding night mode to its iOS app soon: it’s included in the latest beta build for iOS.

I can’t wait for this. Twitter’s dark mode, available right now on Mac and Android, is a great feature. Fingers crossed we see it in the next major update to the iOS app.
