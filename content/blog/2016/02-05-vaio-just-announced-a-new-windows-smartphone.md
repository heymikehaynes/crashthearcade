[Mat Smith for Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2016/02/03/vaio-made-a-windows-phone):

> VAIO’s Windows Phone runs Windows 10, and (on paper) has the specifications to make that work – especially when it comes to Continuum: running a PC environment entirely from your phone. There’s an octocore 1.5GHz Snapdragon 617 processor and a full 3GB of RAM, while the screen is an unassuming full-HD resolution.

> Classier design, accompanied with an arguably more precarious mobile operating system, the phone will be priced at 50,000 yen, around $432.

This really is a gorgeous looking phone, not unlike a small version of the original iPad, with some pretty serious muscle under the hood. It’s consistent, smaller releases like this and steady, incremental updates from Microsoft to the Windows Phone platform that could keep the entire idea alive.
