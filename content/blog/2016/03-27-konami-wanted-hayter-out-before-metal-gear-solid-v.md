> In a blunt interview with Game Informer’s podcast, David Hayter, the longtime voice of Solid Snake until 2014’s Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes and last year’s Phantom Pain, indicated that Konami and Kojima Productions had tried to get rid of him before.
>
>  Hayter told Game Informer he had to re-audition for his role in 2004’s Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.

While I understand the disappointment, his [handling](http://www.polygon.com/2016/1/15/10777456/david-hayter-24-keifer-sutherland-metal-gear-solid) of this whole thing has been a little discouraging to see as a longtime fan. Hayter is a successful screenwriter and has voiced numerous video game characters including the various Snakes since 1998. He has had and will continue to have a great career, with or without Metal Gear and Konami. Just take the [high road](https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1awixe/til_david_hayter_gave_up_half_of_his_own_paycheck/).
