[Nick Summers for Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2016/02/26/alan-wake-sequel-trademark-application):

> A trademark application for “Alan Wake’s Return” was spotted by a user on the gaming forum Neogaf, pointing to another instalment of the Twin Peaks-style thriller. Remedy’s creative director Sam Lake has always said that he would like to return to the franchise, going so far as to release prototype footage. Alan Wake 2 was eventually scrapped in favour of Quantum Break, although some of the team’s ideas eventually wound up in Alan Wake’s American Nightmare.

Oh yes please. Without question the best game I played on the Xbox 360, it’s a **crime** there hasn’t been more interest in a sequel.
