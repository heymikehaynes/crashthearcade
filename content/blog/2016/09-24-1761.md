[Daniel Robson and Jose Otero for IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/18/kojima-calls-out-metal-gear-survives-zomibes):

> Kojima took the opportunity to distance himself from Konami’s forthcoming game Metal Gear Survive, a spin-off from Kojima’s acclaimed Metal Gear series. When asked whether the idea for Survive had come from Kojima himself, he replied, “That’s nothing to do with me!”
> 
>  “The Metal Gear games are about political fiction and espionage,” he continued. “Where do zombies fit in with that?”

This game looks an insult to everything Kojima built.
