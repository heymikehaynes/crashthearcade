Every title will be available for you to watch within a 48-hour period, but you’ll have to pay $50 every time you view it. Steep, but at least you can watch movies in peace, without screaming kids and loud adults in the background.

$50 might seem steep but with the prices of movies going up because of new features, costs, things like 3D, D-Box, etc, it’s really not that much of a stretch. Going to a movie with a friend would run you close if not over this amount when you include concessions and whatnot. Personally, I’d see a heck of a lot more movies on release day if this where an actual service.
