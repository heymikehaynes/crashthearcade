[Juli Clover for MacRumours](https://www.macrumors.com/2016/08/02/samsung-mocks-apple-headphone-jack-removal/):

> While on stage describing the new Galaxy Note7, Samsung marketing VP Justin Denison made sure to point out that its new device comes with a headphone jack as can be seen in the video, shared by iPhoneAddict.fr. “Want to know what else it comes with?” He asked. “An audio jack”.

The jokes lands well with a total of four people in the audience. Samsung’s always walked a very fine [line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc._v._Samsung_Electronics_Co.) in the design of their products. It’s sad that the one thing they can actually brag about is that, for once, they’re not lifting something from Apple. At least, not yet.
