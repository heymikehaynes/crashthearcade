[Mike Sampson for ComicsAlliance](https://comicsalliance.com/critics-batman-v-superman-justice-league-plans/):

> The first critic reviews of Batman v. Superman hit the web last night and early word was… not kind. The film currently sits at 40% on Rotten Tomatoes. By comparison, the divisive Man of Steel had a 56%.

Having now seen the film, I feel like the majority of the hatred for the film seems to stem from pretty minor details. It almost feels like the press was compelled to dislike the movie from the onset and people have just sort of run with it. I mean, it certainly wasn’t great but was it entertaining? I guess, yeah.
