[Ian Hardy for MobileSyrup](https://mobilesyrup.com/2016/06/07/twitter-for-android-updated-with-material-design/):

> Twitter has announced its native app has been overhauled with a “revamped look and feel” in order to move its aesthetic in line with Android’s Material Design guidelines.

The earlier version of the Android Twitter app, in my opinion, suffered from a number of issues revolving around general usability, buttons were placed in awkward locations, buried in other sections, were tough to reach with one hand, etc. With this new update, thanks in large part to the Google design spec, it seems many of those issues have been alleviated.

The new design looks great, it’s much simpler to use, and will give users a much more consistent experience alongside the other apps on their devices.
