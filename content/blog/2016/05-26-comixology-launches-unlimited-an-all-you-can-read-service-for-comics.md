[Brett White for CBR](https://www.cbr.com/new-comixology-unlimited-service-lets-you-read-as-much-as-you-want/):

> For the flat cost of $5.99 a month, readers will be given access to titles from Image Comics, Dark Horse Comics, IDW Publishing, BOOM! Studios, Oni Press, Archie Comics, Valiant Entertainment, Fantagraphics Books and more. Titles available in the Unlimited program will feature an “Unlimited” banner on them in the comiXology store. This includes series like “The Walking Dead,” “Hellboy,” “Saga,” “Attack on Titan,” “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” “Lumberjanes,” “Transformers,” “Love and Rockets,” “Archie,” “Invincible” and “Locke &amp; Key” among many others.

This is an amazing idea. I can’t wait until it arrives in Canada.

You can sign up for Unlimited [here](https://www.comixology.com/unlimited) or through the ComiXology app on your phone/tablet. As mentioned, it’s currently US only.
