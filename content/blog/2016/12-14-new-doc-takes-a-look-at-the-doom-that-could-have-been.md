[Andy Chalk for PC Gamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/doom-resurrected-doc-showcases-call-of-doom-and-the-move-to-a-reboot/):

> Doom 4 was “a lot more cinematic,” and had “a lot more story to it, a lot more characters around you that you were with throughout the course of the gameplay,” id Software’s Marty Stratton says in the video. “It was definitely a twist on Doom that took it into a much more cinematic, much more scripted type of experience.”
> 
>  It was “awesome,” in the words of Hugo Martin, formerly of Naughty Dog, who served the creative director on the 2016 release of Doom, but it didn’t fit the mold.

While I didn’t particularly enjoy the new Doom, id’s focus on delivering an amazing experience to the hardcore Doom fans is commendable. It’s rare to see a studio take a chance like they did and start to whole thing over to please the core fanbase. In all honesty though, I feel I would have had a better experience with this unreleased version by the sounds and look of it.
