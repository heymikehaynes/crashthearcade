[Gary Ng for iPhone in Canada](https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/iphone-6se-rumour/):

> What is Apple going to name the next iPhone? According to the latest rumour from Apfelpage.de, Chinese supply chain sources cite the next smartphone upgrade will be called ‘iPhone 6SE’, not ‘iPhone 7’.

This makes total sense, given how little cosmetic changes are apparently going to be coming to the new device(s). Not to mention, the prior leaks that Apple would be abandoning the tick-tock update schedule in favour of a three year update cycle (6, 6S, ?).

While the next iPhone will certainly be worthwhile for users to update to, I’m thinking we see the big changes arriving next year, including OLED screens, potentially an edge to edge display, and more alongside a logical naming jump from iPhone 6SE to iPhone 7.
