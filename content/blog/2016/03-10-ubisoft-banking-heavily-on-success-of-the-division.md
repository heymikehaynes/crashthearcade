[Brian Crecente for Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/features/2016/3/8/11179934/ubisoft-division-interview-future-watch-dogs-2):

> This week doesn’t mark just the launch of Ubisoft’s latest new franchise with the release of Tom Clancy’s The Division, the leadership at Ubisoft tell us. It’s also the dividing line between the Ubisoft of old and what the future holds for the game publisher responsible for Far Cry, Assassin’s Creed, The Crew and Watch Dogs.

>  “Internally, I’ve heard people saying that for Ubisoft there will be a ‘before The Division’ and an ‘after The Division,’” Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot told Polygon in a recent interview. “That signifies how incredible we think the game is and how much we think it has to offer to players.
> 
>  “The Division is a reference point for our future, and we certainly hope it is a game players will love.”

This is a really great piece.

While I haven’t had a ton of time with the game yet, minimal technical issues aside, The Division is pretty much exactly what I had hoped it would be. In the future, I’d like to see some modifications made to the groups/parties to allow for easier task management but for now, I’m pretty pleased with what Ubisoft and Massive have shipped. Apparently, a [lot](https://www.pcgamer.com/the-division-breaks-ubisoft-sales-records/) of other people are too.
