[Allegra Frank for Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2016/2/11/10966664/assassins-creed-no-new-game-2016):

> Assassin’s Creed is taking the year off, Ubisoft announced today. The publisher won’t release a new entry in the popular franchise during 2016; instead, the development team is “stepping back and re-examining the Assassin’s Creed franchise” according to the post.

Given how many technical [issues](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30226586) the more recent instalments of the series have been, it’s no surprise to me that Ubisoft is taking a step back. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot specifically mentions this as the reason for the break, which seemed inevitable, given how quickly the team was cranking the games out.

It’s interesting timing, given that the movie adaptation arrives in December but this seems like the right move for the future of the franchise.
