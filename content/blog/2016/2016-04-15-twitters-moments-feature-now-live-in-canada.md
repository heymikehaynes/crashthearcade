[Ian Hardy for MobileSyrup](https://mobilesyrup.com/2016/04/12/twitter-moments-now-live-in-canada/):

> Rory Capern took over leadership at Twitter Canada and stated the country is a top ten market with “tremendous growth potential.” Canadians flock to the platform to keep updated on the latest news, sports and entertainment and today it has officially launched Moments in Canada.

Moments reminds me of the old [Discover](http://www.theverge.com/2015/4/8/8371319/twitter-is-killing-off-its-discover-tab) tab that Twitter had a year or so ago but rather than a chaotic mess of information, it’s presented in a nice, digestible card view. Interesting feature, it’ll be neat to see where they take it in future updates.
