> Elza Walker in Resident Evil 1.5 (バイオハザード 1.5) – The first footage of the game was shown at the V Jump Festival ‘96 in July

When I was a kid, I wrote into Gamepro magazine asking them who the heck [Elza Walker](http://residentevil.wikia.com/wiki/Elza_Walker) was and why she wasn’t in the version of Resident Evil 2 I’d been playing. They printed my letter and explained the whole thing.

I’d love to see a brand new entry to the series with her involved in some way.
