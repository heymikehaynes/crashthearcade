[Tom Sykes for PC Gamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/final-fantasy-9-is-finally-coming-to-pc/):

> Final Fantasy IX, the secret best Final Fantasy title, is coming to PC, only 15 years after it released for the original PlayStation. Square Enix announced the news on their Japanese site here (thanks, NeoGAF!), and while there’s no guarantee it’ll release in the West, the fact that you can view that site in English makes me hopeful.

I’ve always considered Final Fantasy IX to be the best game in the series, without question, if only for the unforgettable characters. It’s such an homage to the rest of the games that came before it. From the excellent art direction to classic music, it’s such a tribute to itself.
