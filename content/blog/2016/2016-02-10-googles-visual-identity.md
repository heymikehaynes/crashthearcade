[The Rivalry](https://therivalry.co/project/google-visual-identity):

> We were invited to create a new visual identity for GOOGLE that would adapt to the ever-evolving multi-screen world, without losing the speed and simplicity users love. No small task with over 12 billion searches made monthly and ~200 GOOGLE products to consider. The result is a dynamic system of components beyond the iconic logo.

This is a great case study. I love seeing how an identity of this size appears across a number of surfaces and I can appreciate the work the team put into having a clear, consistent message and vision. The difference between design at Google a handful of years ago and design at Google now really seems to be night and day.

Given how it was covered during the initial [reveal](https://blog.google/technology/design/google-update), I always assumed that Google had developed the logo in-house. Itâ€™s interesting to see not only a company the size of Google taking much of their design work outside of its own walls but also having their Material team work so closely alongside [other](https://www.hugeinc.com/work/google) design firms.
