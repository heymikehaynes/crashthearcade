[Sam Byford for The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/14/11930748/resident-evil-7-e3-hands-on-demo):

> Not to take anything away from Resident Evil 4, which is one of the best and most influential action games of all time, but there’s a case to be made that it set the series on a path to irrelevance. Subsequent entries learned all the wrong lessons, unsuccessfully attempting to go toe-to-toe with action genre heavyweights while forgetting what made the series what it was back in the day: a relentless, foreboding sense of horror.

If a playable teaser released on the PlayStation Network shortly after Sony’s E3 press conference last night is anything to go by, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard represents a major course correction.

This looks great. A change this drastic is a breath of fresh air for a stale franchise. I can’t wait to see more and I hope they don’t change too much for the final release or, you know, [cancel](http://kotaku.com/its-official-silent-hills-is-cancelled-1700379816) it entirely.
