[Michael McWhertor for Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2016/4/7/11384792/fear-effect-series-coming-back-thanks-to-square-enix-collective):

> Fear Effect: Sedna will be the third official game in the franchise, if it meets its crowdfunding goal. Sushee is taking its Fear Effect game to Kickstarter in the coming days and is doing so with the permission of Square Enix Collective, the division of publisher Square Enix that launched in 2013 to help foster and promote indie games. (Square Enix Collective was originally born of a partnership with another crowdfunding site, Indiegogo.)

>  Sushi describes Fear Effect: Sedna as a “brand new adventure, from the streets of Hong Kong to the cold world of Greenland” that features the series four mercenary protagonists Hana, Rain, Glas and Deke.

I played through the original Fear Effect games back when they first arrived on the PlayStation and really dug the Resident Evil-esque gameplay and cel shaded animation. While the games lacked the polish that the RE titles had, both Fear Effect titles were still really enjoyable.

The third game in the series, Fear Effect: Inferno, was in development on the PS2 for years before finally getting axed sometime in the mid-2000s. At that point, I think everyone was pretty sure the series was finished, which makes this announcement a bit of a shocker.

The gameplay looks to have changed from a third-person, fixed-camera shooter to an isometric view point-and-click but at this point, i’ll take what I can get. The team at [Sushee](http://susheegames.com) plans to launch the game via a crowdfunding effort on Kickstarter in the coming days.
