When you boot it back up, the Pidgey is gone. You start to walk a bit further but in game but you’ve been locked in place, so you stand around and wait for it to catch up. You’re stationary and locked to your phone in a way that makes you look like a tourist in your own neighborhood. There’s no flow here, no rhythm to disappear into.

In my time with the game, I experienced an incredible amount of bugs and issues including constant logging out when the app was apparently still running in the background, numerous crashes, and a massive drain on my phone’s battery. To be honest, it also just wasn’t very fun to play.

People are clearly having a blast with the game, which is great, it’s just too much of a technical mess for me to spend any more time with.
