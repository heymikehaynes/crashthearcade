> Google has pushed an update to its Chrome browser for iPhone and iPad, making it nearly 70 percent more stable as well as much faster. The browser now uses Apple’s latest rendering engine, WKWebView, which provides an overall better experience on the iPad and iPhone.

While Chrome has never been unusable on the iPhone, it’s never felt nearly as polished as Apple’s own Safari browser. With the new version, Google has closed the gap and once again shown their dedication to iOS, despite it being a competitor.
