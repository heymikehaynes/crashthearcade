> Microsoft hasn’t said exactly when it plans to end support for the app it acquired last year, but the company has put Sunrise users on notice that it will leave the market after its features get “fully integrated” into Outlook.

Once upon a time, Sunrise was my go-to iOS calendar replacement. When Microsoft bought the team in early 2015, I had hoped it meant more than the app getting swallowed up and merged into Outlook. It’ll be a sad day when they pull the plug.
