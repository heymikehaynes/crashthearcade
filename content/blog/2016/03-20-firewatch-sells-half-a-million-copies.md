[Owen S. Good for Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/19/11269280/firewatch-sales-pc-ps4-psn):

> Panic, the publisher who partnered with developing studio Campo Santo, announced the sales total in a retrospective post on its blog yesterday. Firewatch had been the top-selling downloadable game on PlayStation Store in February (its only console presence). But at 500,000 copies sold, “Firewatch can be considered a sales success,” wrote Cabel Sasser, Panic’s co-founder.

I played through this shortly after release in February and fell totally in love with it. I can already say with certainty that it’ll be on my list of must-play games for the year. It’s really exciting to see the studio achieve this level of success so far. The game is entirely deserving of the praise.
