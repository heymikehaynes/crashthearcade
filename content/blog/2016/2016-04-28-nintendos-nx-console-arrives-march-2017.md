[Nick Summers for Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-27-nintendo-nx-launch-march-2017.html):

> Weâ€™ve heard plenty of rumors since then, including a console-handheld hybrid, a system more powerful than the PS4 and Xbox One, and a console with a bizarre touchscreen controller (including faked photos) based on Nintendo patents. The house of Mario has stayed quiet throughout, stating only that it will talk about the console later in 2016.

Just posting a tweet with a release date is a pretty weird way to announce a console. Nintendo has confirmed that their E3 presence will include the new Zelda title and really not much else, not even the NX.
