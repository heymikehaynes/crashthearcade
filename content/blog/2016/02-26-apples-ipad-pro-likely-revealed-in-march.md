[Gary Ng for iPhone in Canada](http://www.iphoneincanada.ca/ipad/9-7-inch-ipad-pro):

> While we all suspected an iPad Air 3 was set to be announced, Gurman now says itâ€™s going to be marketed as a 9.7-inch iPad Pro, bringing the tablet into the same family as the 12.9-inch iPad Pro.

As someone who was waiting it out to replace an iPad Air, my fear is that the premium name will come with a premium price.
