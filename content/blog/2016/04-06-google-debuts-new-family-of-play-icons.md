[Android Blog](https://blog.google/products/google-play/a-new-look-for-google-play-family-of-apps/):

> You’ll start to see the new Google Play icons across devices and online in the coming weeks. We hope you’ll continue enjoying the Play family of products—now with a new look.

I really dig the new look. Very consistent, seems like they’ll play well with the design Google’s slowly refined over the past couple of years. I’m especially excited to see that new Play Music icon make its way (hopefully) over to iOS. The current app icon is, to put it lightly, not my favourite.
