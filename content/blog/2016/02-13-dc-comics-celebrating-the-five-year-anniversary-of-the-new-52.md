[Susana Polo for Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/comics/2016/2/12/10979952/dc-comics-celebrates-classic-covers-from-five-whole-years-ago):

> May 2016 is the month that every title that launched at the start of the New 52 will hit its 52nd issue. Of those initial 52, only 11 have made it to this milestone, and DC will be adorning those comics with variant covers that give another artist a crack at the cover of the title’s first issue.

While it seems a little weird to me for DC to be honouring themselves after only the five year anniversary of the New 52, it’s a wonderful opportunity to right some wrongs, such as a new Catwoman cover by Inaki Miranda.

What makes the whole thing even more interesting is that it coincides more or less with the reported “rebirth” that DC will be going through with shortly after this, potentially negating this entire celebration. It’s confusing, to say the least.
