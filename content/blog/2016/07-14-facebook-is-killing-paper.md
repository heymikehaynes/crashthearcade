[Bryan Clark for The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2016/06/30/facebook-shuttering-news-app-paper-july-29th/):

> Paper was beautifully designed and almost universally adored by the design community for its novel animations, clean UI and immersive experience that provided an entirely ad-free way to view your newsfeed. The app transformed the typical newsfeed into a Apple News-esque reader, complete with customizable sections for a variety of topics from food to politics.

I think I understand why they’re moving away from the app, likely because Paper doesn’t encourage the velocity normal users require while browsing Facebook, but damn if it isn’t disappointing. Paper was unlike anything Facebook has ever done and likely will ever do again.
