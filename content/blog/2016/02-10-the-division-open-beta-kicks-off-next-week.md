[Edgar Alvareza for Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2016/02/09/the-division-is-getting-an-open-beta-next-week):

> If you didn’t participate in The Division’s recent closed beta, don’t worry – you’re going to have another chance to play the game soon. Ubisoft has announced open beta dates for its new Tom Clancy title, which will be available on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC.

I took part in the closed beta for The Division a couple weeks back and really enjoyed it. It’s a game that grabbed my attention back when it was revealed in 2013 and hasn’t really let go. It’s got a large, gorgeous world, solid third-person combat, and an addictive scavenging component akin to something like DayZ or H1Z1.

I’m looking forward to jumping back in and spending more time with it before the official release in March.
