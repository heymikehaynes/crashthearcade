# [Tim Cook hints more Apple apps could come to Android ↦](http://www.engadget.com/2016/02/04/tim-cook-apple-apps-on-android-rumor)

> Apple stepped into the Android waters late last year with the launch of Apple Music on Google’s competing mobile OS. But if comments made by Tim Cook at recent “Town Hall” event for Apple employees are to be believed, it might not be the last. According to sources at the event who reported info to *9to5Mac*, Cook said that Apple Music on Android was a way of “testing the waters” to see if it could further expand its services division on Android.
