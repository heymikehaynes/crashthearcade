[Andrew Webster for The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/25/11113234/resident-evil-4-5-6-ps4-xbox-one):

> A trio of Resident Evil games is on its way to modern consoles. Today Capcom announced that Resident Evil 4, 5, and 6, will all be coming to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One later this year. The games appear to be largely straight ports without much in the way of improvements for the newer hardware.

While I can appreciate bringing RE4 to a new generation of gamers, given how much it changed the series and third-person shooters in general, RE5 should never be allowed to see the light of day. It is, in my opinion, the lowest point of the series.

When will we be getting an entirely new instalment? Maybe a complete reboot? An anniversary seems like a pretty great time for an [announcement](http://comicbook.com/2016/02/26/nintendo-announces-pokemon-sun-and-moon-for-20th-anniversary/) if you ask me.
