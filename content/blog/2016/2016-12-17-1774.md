Facebook’s Messenger app for iOS has become progressively more awful. Feature creep has compromised what was once a very simple, user-friendly app. I’d almost consider switching to Android just to be able to use [Messenger Lite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.mlite&hl=en).
