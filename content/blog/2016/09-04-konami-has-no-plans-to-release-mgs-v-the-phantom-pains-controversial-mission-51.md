[Brian Ashcraft for Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/konami-has-no-plans-to-finish-mgsv-the-phantom-pains-mi-1785988932):

> One of Metal Gear Solid V’s most important plot points, Mission 51, ended up on the cutting room floor. Today, Konami said it does not plan to finish this mission.

The dodgy [answers](https://twitter.com/metalgear_en/status/770662138486546432) Konami gives as to why this mission isn’t included in the upcoming “definitive edition” of the game, essentially saying the mission isn’t nearly as important to the ending as we think it is, are incredibly frustrating and very disappointing for longtime fans of the series.

While I understand leaving excess content on the cutting room floor or leaving the ending somewhat ambiguous by design, I simply can’t wrap my head around leaving critical plot details that were well into development (and shown to players) out of the finished product.

Despite what the company claims about Mission 51 not being the true ending of the game, if you’ve watched the [footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B4JIHh5Jqk) or [read](http://kotaku.com/one-of-metal-gear-solid-vs-most-important-story-scenes-1728467641) into the mission even slightly, it’s clearly the opposite. It’s mind-boggling as to why it’ll never see the light of day.
