[Emma Roth for The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/28/23849754/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-remote-employees-return-to-office):

> In a recording of the meeting obtained by Insider, Jassy told workers, “It’s past the time to disagree and commit,” adding that “if you can’t disagree and commit… it’s probably not going to work out for you at Amazon because we are going back to the office at least three days a week.”

I’ve heard it said best, I can’t remember where, that CEOs like Jassy push so hard for a return-to-work because they literally can’t empathize in any way with their employees and the benefits remote work has on their lives. CEOs don’t have to worry about organizing and paying for child care or the costs (money *and* time) of commuting to and from the office.

When it’s not a situation you’ll ever understand, why force your employees into it?
