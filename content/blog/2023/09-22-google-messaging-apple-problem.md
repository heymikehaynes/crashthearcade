[Amber Neely for appleinsider](https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/09/21/google-continues-to-push-for-rcs-integration-on-apple-devices-with-new-meet-ipager-video):

> The video, dubbed "Meet iPager," is heavily stylized to look like one of Apple's signature product launch videos. The video introduces the iPager, a fictitious device that stifles innovation and uses outdated technology to text cross-platform.

Google has had ample opportunity to address their messaging situation. Making it Apple's problem (again) is tired and lazy.
