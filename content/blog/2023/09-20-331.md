[Jennifer Pattison Tuohy for The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/23882652/amazon-echo-hub-smart-home-controller-hands-on):

> The new smart home-focused widgets make it easy to interact with to do things like view a camera live view, adjust a light, or run a routine with a tap. These three new widgets can be added to the Home screen: one is specific to the room the device is in, one is for any connected cameras (it can show a recent snapshot from Ring cameras at launch), and one mirrors the favorites in the Alexa app.

Amazon hasn’t confirmed anything yet but I’m hopeful they’ll bring this new look to the other devices in the Echo lineup. The UI on our Show 15 looks ancient by comparison and an update like this could help inject some life back into it.
