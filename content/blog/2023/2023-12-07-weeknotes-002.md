It took two weeks but I’m finally feeling better. Having run the gamut of headaches, nausea, fever, chills, and back to headaches, I’ve had my fill of sickness for a while. If you needed another reminder: mask up. It’s terrible out there.

## Game collection update

I hacked together a way to track the games I’m playing in a more visual way on my blog. First, I created a new content type from posts, complete with its own dedicated page in the dashboard. I can set a title, description, platform, a link to IGDB (or elsewhere), and a featured image to have it appear in my /now page. The next evolution of this would be to connect to IGDB’s API and automate it but I’ll save that for a rainy day.

## Speaking of games

I’ve started [The Invincible](https://invinciblethegame.com/), a hard sci-fi walking-sim based on the 1964 novel by Stanisław Lem. I’m not far enough in to give a good review of it but it’s been enjoyable so far. There hasn’t been much on my radar since Alan Wake II. Next year starts with a bang. Persona 3 Reload, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and Dragon’s Dogma II are all coming before April.

## Mammoth 2

There’s a new version of the Mastodon app [Mammoth](https://apps.apple.com/app/mammoth-for-mastodon/id1667573899) out today. I was apprehensive about it during my earlier testing but it’s grown on me. The For You page and Smart Lists, in particular, are interesting. They improve discoverability of new people to follow and news stories for topics you’re interested in. I’m curious how those will evolve and improve.

## Some inspiration

[Luke](https://typo.social/@Luke) reached out yesterday and praised my /now and /photos pages. He and [José](https://mastodon.design/@jd) said they felt inspired to make their own. This made my week.

## Default app updates

More than 250 people have [shared](https://defaults.rknight.me) their personalized default apps list. This is *crazy*. I’ve already changed some of my apps since posting my initial list.

- I couldn’t resist the savings of my Spotify family plan and switched back from Apple Music.
- I’m now using NetNewsWire (with iCloud) for RSS feeds instead of Reeder and Feedbin.
- I use Safari’s built-in feature for saving articles to read later, switching from Instapaper/Matter.
- I turned to Keychain after struggling with 1Password’s recent updates.
