> Notably, Sweeney does not apologize to his employees for making the business decisions that have resulted in the disruption of over 800 lives, saying only that his “optimism” that such spending would not result in layoffs was “unrealistic.”

Brutal news and not a great look for Sweeney. During his many battles with Apple and Google, he makes himself out to be someone who cares about developers, but his message to the employees he let go seems insensitive and borderline insulting.
