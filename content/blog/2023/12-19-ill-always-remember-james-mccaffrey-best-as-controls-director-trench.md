[Gita Jackson for Aftermath](https://aftermath.site/ill-always-remember-james-mccaffrey-best-as-controls-director-trench):

> In many ways I don’t think Control works without McCaffrey’s performance. His Trench gives the whole game an emotional depth that anchors it to reality, especially as the game becomes increasingly surreal.

Control was also the first game I thought of when hearing about McCaffrey’s passing. I’ve played all the titles he’s known for but his performance as Trench really stuck with me.

First, Lance Reddick, and now McCaffrey. Remedy’s connected universe won’t be the same without them.
