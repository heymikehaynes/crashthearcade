[Chris Moyse for Destructoid](https://www.destructoid.com/zenless-zone-zero-is-a-new-funky-fantasy-from-genshin-impacts-mihoyo/):

> Zenless Zone Zero, (or “ZZZ“), is set in the aftermath of a global cataclysm, where seemingly random anomalies known as “Hollows” have been swallowing up huge chunks of civilization, dispersing monstrous creatures known as “The Ethereal”.

Zenless Zone Zero looks interesting and has a style that reminds me of Persona 5. I like the fantasy of Genshin and the sci-fi of Honkai, so I'm curious what miHoYo's vision of a more "modern" game would look like.
