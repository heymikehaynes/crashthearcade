# [Tweetbot and other Twitter apps still broken as Elon Musk stays silent](https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/13/tweetbot-twitter-apps-still-broken-elon-musk-api/)

> Twitter’s official API for developers is almost entirely offline. This means that popular third-party Twitter apps like Twitteriffic and Tweetbot are completely broken. When you open Tweetbot, for example, you see an error message explaining that there was a “problem authenticating with Twitter.”

Another big brain move from the big brain baby.
