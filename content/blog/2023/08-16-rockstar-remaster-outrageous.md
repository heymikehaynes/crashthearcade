> People have been expressing outrage over the $50 price tag for a 13-year-old port that’s not even coming to PC, and one person on Reddit even shows it’s cheaper to buy the game and an Xbox console than pay for the re-release.

Instead of complaining about Red Read Remaster’s price on PS4 and then buying it anyway, I’d ask that you consider not buying the game. Take-Two needs to understand that people won’t put up with this anymore.
