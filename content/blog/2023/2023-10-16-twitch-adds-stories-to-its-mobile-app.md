> Stories on Twitch will function just like the feature does on other social media apps. Qualified users can post pictures, text messages, or clips that will disappear after 48 hours. Viewers will be able to see stories from the creators they follow in a dedicated space at the top of the Twitch app.

Twitch is one of only a few apps I can think of where including stories makes sense, unlike countless others we’ve seen force the feature on users over the years. Adding quick snippets of video to supplement a stream feels like a natural fit but we’ll see how creators take to them once they’re widely available.
