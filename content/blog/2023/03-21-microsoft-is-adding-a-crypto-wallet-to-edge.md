[Tom Warren for The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/21/23649834/microsoft-edge-cryptocurrency-wallet-feature):

> Microsoft Edge will advertise the ability to purchase cryptocurrency from Coinbase and MoonPay through [a] built-in crypto wallet. It will also include the ability to connect decentralized apps to the wallet feature and support collecting and storing non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Like many, I don’t need a crypto wallet, let alone one built into my browser. It benefits me in no way and only adds to the visual noise of Edge’s already overwhelming feature set. What’s concerning here is that Microsoft chose to prioritize work on *this* during a “period of focus” where they fired 10,000 people, including their [AI ethics team](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/13/23638823/microsoft-ethics-society-team-responsible-ai-layoffs).

This is both wildly out of touch with what consumers want and an insult to the people the company let go over the past couple months.
