> Zenless Zone Zero, (or “ZZZ“), is set in the aftermath of a global cataclysm, where seemingly random anomalies known as “Hollows” have been swallowing up huge chunks of civilization, dispersing monstrous creatures known as “The Ethereal”.

The story sounds interesting and I love the style they’re going for, reminds me of Persona 5. I’ve always enjoyed Genshin’s fantasy world but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t curious what miHoYo’s idea of a “modern” world would look like.
