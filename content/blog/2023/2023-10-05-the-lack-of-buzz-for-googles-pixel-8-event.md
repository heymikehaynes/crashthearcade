[John Gruber at Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/2023/10/googles_pixel_8_event):

> It’s also impossible not to comment on just how much less interest there is in Google’s Pixel ecosystem. Google’s event garnered only a sliver of the attention Apple’s did, and their devices, similarly, have only a fraction of the sales Apple’s do.

I feel like this happens every year.

When Apple had their event at the beginning of the month, there was coverage from the dozens of Apple news and rumour sites *plus* sites like Android Police, 9to5Google, droidlife, and even PC Gamer.

When Google ran the same event this week, they got coverage from dedicated Android and Google outlets too but, best I can tell, from the Apple camp, only MacRumors wrote about it.

It’s clear Google just can’t drum up the same excitement for their hardware reveals as Apple can.
