> Amazon announced on Monday plans to eliminate about 9,000 more positions in the next few weeks, mostly in Amazon Web Services (AWS), PXT, Advertising, and Twitch, as part of the company’s cost-cutting measures. […] “This was a difficult decision, but one that we think is best for the company long term,” said Amazon’s CEO [Andy Jassy].

Jassy [reportedly](https://futurism.com/the-byte/replacing-ceos-with-ai-makes-sense) made over $210 million in 2021, which is the combined salaries of nearly 6,500 Amazonians. If they’re looking for ways to save money, maybe they could start there?
