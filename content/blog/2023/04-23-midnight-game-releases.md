> I feel like we’ve collectively lost something from that as a community. The electric atmosphere of the wait outside the local game store, the excitement of everyone around you being hyped for the same game. Without that, it feels like we’ve lost the social aspect of a big release.

I only went to a handful myself (and worked some) but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t miss them a little bit.
