[Casey Newton for The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/8/23824184/elon-musk-news-coverage-criticism):

> Musk’s broken promises have yet to reach anything near the volume of lies that Trump told as president. But given his recent track record, it’s well past time for the press to grant him an equal measure of skepticism.

The guy's been spewing warped timelines, impossible solutions, and outright bullshit to people for <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/elon-musk-twitter-zuckerberg-lies-1234808808/funding-secured-1234808816/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">years</a>, but *now* you're skeptical of him? Snap out of it.
