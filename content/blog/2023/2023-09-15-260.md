The inaccurate reporting of [non-standard USC-C ports](https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/15/iphone-15-usb-c-port-compatibility/), [removal of silicone cases](https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/09/10/apple-may-discontinue-silicone-iphone-case-in-eco-friendly-push), and [a lack of battery updates](https://www.androidauthority.com/iphone-15-battery-life-3363745/) in this year’s iPhone lineup is a great reminder to take those Apple rumour sites with a grain of salt, if you weren’t already.
