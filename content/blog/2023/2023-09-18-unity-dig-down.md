[Sophie McEvoy for GamesIndustry.biz](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/unity-reportedly-told-dev-planned-parenthood-and-childrens-hospital-are-not-not-valid-charities):

> Developers of indie puzzle game Orgynizer have claimed that Unity said organisations like Planned Parenthood are “not valid charities” and are instead “political groups.”

As if the [runtime nonsense](https://blog.unity.com/news/plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates) wasn’t bad enough, this is the icing on a cake made of garbage. I’m not developing a game but, if I were, Unity would be the last thing I’d be using to make it.
