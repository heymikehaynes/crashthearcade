> Developers of indie puzzle game Orgynizer have claimed that Unity said organisations like Planned Parenthood are “not valid charities” and are instead “political groups.”

As if the [runtime nonsense](https://blog.unity.com/news/plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates) wasn’t bad enough, this is the icing on a cake made of garbage. I’m not developing a game but, if I were, Unity would be the last thing I’d be using to make it.
