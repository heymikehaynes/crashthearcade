> The analyst is expecting the base model iPhone 15 price to remain unchanged, but sees $100 price bumps for both the 6.1-inch Pro and 6.7-inch Pro Max. This would be the first time Apple has increased pro iPhone prices since the iPhone X debuted at $999 in 2017.

The last time this happened, nobody cared. Customers finance phones through their carriers, through Apple directly, or have enough disposable income to buy it outright and, at that point, donâ€™t care about $100.
