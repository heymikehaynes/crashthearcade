[PlayStation Blog](https://blog.playstation.com/2023/01/04/introducing-project-leonardo-for-playstation-5-a-highly-customizable-accessibility-controller-kit/):

> Through conversations with accessibility experts and incredible organizations like AbleGamers, SpecialEffect and Stack Up, we’ve designed a highly configurable controller that works in tandem with many third-party accessibility accessories and integrates with the PS5 console to open up new ways of gaming.

This is great. It’s nice to see both Microsoft, with [their adaptive controller](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/xbox-adaptive-controller), and now Sony making video games more accessible for everyone.
