I had the pleasure of meeting George Pérez at a local convention back in 2012. George was one of the friendliest, professional people I’ve met at a show. He loved the chance to revisit the Scarlet Witch in a sketch for my wife, which hangs on our wall today.

Rest In Peace, George. You’ll be missed.
