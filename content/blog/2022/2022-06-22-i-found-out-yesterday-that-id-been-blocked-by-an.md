I found out yesterday that I’d been blocked by an artist I like on Twitter. The reason appears to be because I unfollowed them last year during one of their more heated rants about working for the bigger comic book publishers.

I’m not going to name names. Ultimately, it’s up to them who they want to see their content and who they don’t. I’ve always looked at following/unfollowing like moving in and out of conversations, but I know not everyone feels the same.
