[Xenoblade Chronicles 3’s release date has been pushed forward](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xenoblade-chronicles-3s-release-date-has-been-pushed-forward/)

<div class="link_description">It’s rare a release date is bumped ahead, never mind by two months. I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a *little* funny to see how smoothly this game is moving along compared to Breath of the Wild 2, which has been delayed several times. I’m excited to play XC3 sooner than later.
