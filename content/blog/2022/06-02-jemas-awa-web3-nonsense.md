[Bill Jemas via Bleeding Cool](https://bleedingcool.com/comics/bill-jemas-statement-about-leaving-awa-starting-be-good-studios/):

> \[Be Good Studios will\] start with award-winning independent film makers and animators who co-create original stories with wonderfully talented webtoon and comic book artists. Then, we build audience with promotional partners and raise funding for feature films and TV series with strategic Web 3 investors.

“Strategic Web 3 investors”?

This is doomed to fail.
