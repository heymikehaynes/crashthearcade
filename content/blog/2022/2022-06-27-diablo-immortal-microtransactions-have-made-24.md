# [Diablo Immortal microtransactions have made $24 million](https://www.pcgamesn.com/diablo-immortal/microtransactions-revenue)

> Players have also noticed a discrepancy in how the game awards legendary gems, which are crucial for completing Diablo Immortalâ€™s late and endgame challenges. The in-game loot which a player can obtain during a single day has also been found to have been discretely capped, meaning that players are forced to log in and play every day if they want to make the most out of their time grinding endgame dungeons.

This is so sad. What a repugnant, predatory company.
