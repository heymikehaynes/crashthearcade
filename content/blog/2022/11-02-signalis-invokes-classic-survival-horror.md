[Nic Reuben for Rock, Paper, Shotgun](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/signalis-review):

> If you’ve got any affection for PS1 survival horror, queer android love stories, cold war paranoia aesthetics, retrofuturism, or cosmic horror when people who aren’t Lovecraft do far more interesting stuff with it, Signalis is a must play.

I haven’t finished a lot of the games I’ve started this year but Signalis might be the best thing I’ve played in 2022.
