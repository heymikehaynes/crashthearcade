I enjoyed the presentation overall but I was a little turned off by the sheer number of sci-fi horror games, though it’s hard to fault the studios for that. Maybe it could have been staggered better during the presentation itself?

I’m excited we got to see more [Zenless Zone Zero](https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us) and I’m pleased it’s shaping up to be similar in gameplay to Genshin. Having enjoyed Golf Club: Wasteland, I think [Highwater](https://demagogstudio.com/Highwater) could be fun. I’m disheartened but not surprised that Keighley didn’t take a harder stance on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and was disappointed we couldn’t see more [Replaced](https://playreplaced.com) because of it.

I thought I’d be more interested in [Callisto Protocol](https://callisto.sds.com) but the **aggressive** focus on gore and its uncanny similarity to the original Dead Space has actually turned me off from the game entirely.
