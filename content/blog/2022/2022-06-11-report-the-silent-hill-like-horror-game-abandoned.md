# [Report: The Silent Hill-like horror game Abandoned is in disarray](https://www.pcgamer.com/report-the-silent-hill-like-horror-game-abandoned-is-in-disarray/)

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full">![](https://runrunrobot.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/jMPhWkHDdNCrpepWJ63c9g-1024-80.webp)</figure>> The game is effectively stalled, while creative direction has changed multiple times, from its original inception as a survival-horror game about being trapped in the forest with a bloodthirsty cult to a story about a “rampant” AI and, more recently, a game about vampires.
