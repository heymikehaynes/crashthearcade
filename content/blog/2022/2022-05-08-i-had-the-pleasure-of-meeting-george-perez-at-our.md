I had the pleasure of meeting George Pérez at our local comic convention back in 2012. George was one of the friendliest, most professional people I’ve ever met at a show, and he loved the opportunity to revisit the Scarlet Witch in a sketch for my wife, which hangs on our wall today.

Rest In Peace, George. You will be missed.
