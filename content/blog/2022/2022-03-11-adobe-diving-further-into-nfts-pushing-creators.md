[Adi Robertson for The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/9/22967057/adobe-nft-behance-polygon-blockchain-support):

> With this new feature, artists can mint NFTs with Polygon on the popular marketplace OpenSea, display the image associated with them on Behance, and direct viewers to OpenSea where they can buy it. Adobe began adding NFT support in late 2021, starting with a program called Content Credentials, which links creator attribution details with an NFT image in Photoshop.

It’s funny to see companies like Adobe jumping into this mess, using “[eco-friendly](https://news.sky.com/story/wwf-uk-faces-backlash-over-destructive-plans-to-sell-eco-friendly-nfts-12531042)” blockchains, skipping any sort of due diligence, to capitalize on the money people are blowing on this crap.

The velocity of these NFT-related updates is particularly interesting given Adobe’s track record. Prior to the release of XD, many designers were left in the cold for years to use some frustrating combination of Photoshop, Illustrator, and Invision to get their work done. When apps like Sketch and Figma launched, most designers I know moved away from Adobe products as it seemed the company couldn’t care less about the needs of interface/product designers.

Fast forward to today, within a year of their rise in popularity amongst artists (or aspiring ones), Adobe has made several updates to their products to support NFTs, helping perpetuate what is largely considered a Ponzi scheme, ripe with scams, plagiarism, and fraud.

Good to know what their priorities are I guess.
