Sad to see this (Eisner Award winning) run of [Black Widow](https://href.li/?https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/29700/black_widow_2020_-_present) come to a close but excited it’s going out on such a high note.

Thompson, Casagrande, De Latorre, and Hughes have kept the series exciting and consistent from the beginning. It’ll make an amazing collected edition when Marvel inevitably releases it.
