I found this weekend of gaming showcases hard to follow and more of a time commitment than I cared to make.

That said, digging through the news from these events, I found a handful of games that got me excited like horror anthology The Fridge is Red, survival game Arctic Awakening that’s being compared to John Carpenter’s The Thing, and a metroidvania-soulslike game called The Last Faith.

Xbox’s big Starfield gameplay reveal left me disappointed. Between noticeable issues with the demo’s frame rate, to the familiar clunkiness of the Creation Engine (even as a 2.0), I wasn’t super sold as Todd Howard described features that games like No Man’s Sky and Elite: Dangerous have had for years.
