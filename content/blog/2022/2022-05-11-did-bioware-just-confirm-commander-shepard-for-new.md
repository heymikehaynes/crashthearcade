[Did BioWare just confirm Commander Shepard for new Mass Effect?](https://mobilesyrup.com/2022/05/10/bioware-new-mass-effect-commander-shepard-confirmation-deleted-post/)

<div class="link_description">Not to get too sweaty here but that doesn’t make sense. If your character dies, there’s no logical way to “canonically” play the subsequent game. For example, if your Shepard was lost at the end of Mass Effect 2′s suicide mission, then Mass Effect 3 is unplayable for you unless you create a new character.

The choice-driven ethos is just fine.
