<figure class="wp-block-pullquote">> Never let people tell you that you simply don’t get web3. It’s self-referential and non-existent which is why web3 advocates talk in abstract circles like this and struggle to define, explain, or distinguish it. There’s little reason to keep giving them the benefit of the doubt.
