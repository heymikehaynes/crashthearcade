# [Tim Sale, one of comics’ greatest storytellers, dies at age 66](https://www.thepopverse.com/tim-sale-comic-artist-obituary)

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://runrunrobot.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/tim-sale-rip-1024x576.jpeg)</figure>> *Tim Sale is best known for his work on the limited series Batman: The Long Halloween and Daredevil: Yellow, and has a 39-year ouvre which includes work on Superman, Captain America, Grendel, Hulk, Catwoman, and more.*

Tim Sale was an absolute legend and a favourite of mine, primarily for his work on [Spider-Man: Blue](https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/2072/spider-man_blue_2002_-_2003), a book widely considered to be one of the greatest Spidey stories ever told.

Condolences to his friends and family, he’ll be greatly missed.
