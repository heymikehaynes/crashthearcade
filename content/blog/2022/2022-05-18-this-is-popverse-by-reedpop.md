[This is Popverse by ReedPop](https://www.thepopverse.com/popverse-welcome-launch)

<div class="link_description">Not sure the world needs *yet another* pop-culture website but I’m happy to see Chris Arrant at the helm. With his history, I’m hopeful that comics will have more coverage at Popverse than similar websites that broadly cover pop-culture.
