I was trying to clean up my monthly subscriptions a bit and thought I could get away with using Feedly’s free plan for my RSS needs instead of my longtime favourite, [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com). This was a huge mistake.

For $5 per month, Feedbin gives me basically everything I could possibly need. I can create mute filters, follow newsletters or twitter accounts, it’s made by a crazy small, super talented team of people… the list goes on and on. It’s honestly worth every penny. I have no clue what I was thinking.
