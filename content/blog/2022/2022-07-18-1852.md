> One of the features is the integration of certain videogames on the car’s internal screens, which was shown off by an account dedicated to, well, showing off Teslas. Musk was on it immediately, and unexpectedly revealed that the cars will soon boast Steam integration.

I’ve said this before but adding functionality like this seems super dangerous. I understand the intention is to entertain passengers during a drive, or give the driver something to do while the vehicle charges, but based on what we’ve seen others do with these things, some people will definitely try to play while driving, despite whatever limitations Tesla might try to put in place.

Updates like these, that add games to the infotainment system, combined with Tesla’s [half-baked](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/18/cars/tesla-full-self-driving-brooklyn/index.html) “Autopilot” or “Full Self-Driving” feature are a recipe for disaster for not only the people in the Tesla itself, but those around them on the road.
