[Chris Arrant for Popverse](https://www.thepopverse.com/popverse-welcome-launch):

> Popverse focuses on the delectable media franchises people come to conventions for, with breaking news, expert commentary, and engrossing conversations with the people behind the things we all love.

Not sure the world needs yet another pop-culture website but I’m happy to see Chris Arrant at the helm. With his history, I’m hopeful that comics will have more coverage at Popverse than similar websites that cover pop-culture.
