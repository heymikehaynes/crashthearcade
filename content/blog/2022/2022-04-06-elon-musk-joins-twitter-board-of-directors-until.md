# [Elon Musk joins Twitter board of directors until 2024](https://mobilesyrup.com/2022/04/05/elon-musk-twitter-board-of-directors/)

> According to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing spotted by *The Verge*, Twitter appointed Musk as a ‘class II’ director until 2024. *The Verge* notes that type of position can be used as an anti-takeover measure.

Yeah, I’m sure nothing horrifying will come of this.
