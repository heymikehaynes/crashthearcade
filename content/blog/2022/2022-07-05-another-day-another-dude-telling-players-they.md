> “Transmedia and the power of connected worlds has always been something I’ve been extremely passionate about. There is a bit of a misunderstanding in my opinion on what blockchain gaming could mean for gamers. I see the blockchain as a railway and the main station is videogames.”

I wish all these dudes trying desperately to get players to buy into NFTs in video games would realize once and for all it’s not that we don’t understand the benefit, it’s that **there is no benefit** to us. We do not care about using blockchains to resell in-game items when we’re done with them.

No studio has delivered a single unique and compelling reason for players to want NFTs in their games, including Mumbauer’s new studio Liithos. Instead of delivering a clear, logical rationale as to why the studio’s upcoming game Ashfall requires “web3″ technology, Mumbauer drops a convoluted analogy about train stations and says, essentially, that they’ll explain it *later*.

Maybe he’s the one who doesn’t understand it?
