# [Diablo Immortal microtransactions have sparked a brutal backlash](https://www.pcgamer.com/diablo-immortal-microtransactions-have-sparked-a-brutal-backlash)

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full">![](https://runrunrobot.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NqVyvJeHCnkczWGGi3BpXQ-1024-80.webp)</figure>> Numerous threads criticizing the monetization have appeared in the Diablo Immortal subreddit, while the iOS version languishes with an abysmal 0.6 score across nearly 1,700 user reviews on Metacritic.
