[Ubisoft VP Nicolas Pouard via Finder](https://www.finder.com.au/ubisoft-interview-nfts):

> “It’s really beneficial. But they don’t get it for now. Also, this is part of a paradigm shift in gaming. Moving from one economic system to another is not easy to handle.”

Players don’t like existing “economic systems” in games like microtransactions. They want less of that, not a convoluted way to spend even more money on a game they paid full price for.

It’s not that we don’t get it, it’s that we **do not want it.**
