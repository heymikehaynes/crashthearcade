[Matthew Gault for VICE](https://www.vice.com/en/contributor/matthew-gault):

> A group of opportunistic fans want to mint Magic: Gathering the cards into NFTs, creating a new format in the process, codifying the scarcity of certain cards on the blockchain, and cementing the idea that seemingly no one involved in the crypto space has ever heard of the idea of copyright.

First the DAO that [bought](https://www.wired.com/story/nft-cryptocurrency-art-regulation-law/) the Dune production book and assumed they owned the copyright to use however they wanted and now this. Between the negligence, legal ineptitude, and outright stupidity, how is anyone ever expected to take this garbage seriously?
