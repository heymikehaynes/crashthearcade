[Jacob Hale for Dexerto](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/dr-disrespect-critics-missing-point-with-nfts-in-project-moon-game-1784936/):

> Dr Disrespect announced in March that his upcoming game ‘Project Moon’ from Midnight Society would feature NFT features and, as expected, was met with vitriol from critics who simply didn’t understand what was happening. But the Doc is actually providing an NFT offering that will benefit players — and more importantly, one that they don’t even need to opt in to.

I’m sick of hearing people say that the hostility surrounding NFTs stems from not understanding them. The people most critical of NFTs absolutely understand them and realize, especially in the gaming space, that they don’t uniquely solve any problem players are having and any benefits are entirely speculative.

Putting myself in the shoes of someone looking for the next big online game, I’d be concerned that this is where a studio has decided to put their energy instead of using established mechanisms and patterns for tier-based rewards and community engagement so they can focus on showing off and shipping the game as soon as possible.
