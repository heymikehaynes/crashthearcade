[Rich Stanton for PC Gamer](https://href.li/?https://www.pcgamer.com/yikes-sonys-new-subscription-doubles-the-price-of-streaming-playstation-games-on-pc/):

> When it replaces the existing PS Now streaming service, Premium (the most expensive tier) will be the only one that lets you play PlayStation games on PC. Premium costs $17.99 monthly / $49.99 quarterly / $119.99 yearly in the US.

> Currently you can subscribe to PS Now, without an additional PS+ subscription, and you’d be paying $9.99 monthly/$24.99 quarterly/$59.99 for an annual subscription. Accessing PlayStation games on PC is about to double in price.

This is obviously frustrating for PC players but consider that, as of 2020, it was [reported](https://href.li/?https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21263492/sony-playstation-subscribers-active-users-ps4-subscription) PlayStation Now had hit 2.2 million subscribers. Of that 2.2 million, [according to Jim Ryan](https://href.li/?https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2022-03-29-sony-merges-ps-now-and-ps-plus-to-create-three-tier-subscription-service), 25% are not subscribed to PlayStation Plus. This would lead me to believe that there are **at most** 550k~ PC PlayStation Now users.
