I enjoyed the presentation overall but I was a little turned off by the sheer number of sci-fi horror games, though it’s hard to fault the studios for that. Maybe it could have been staggered better during the presentation itself?

I’m excited we got to see more Zenless Zone Zero and I’m pleased it’s shaping up to be similar in gameplay to Genshin. Having enjoyed Golf Club: Wasteland, I think Highwater could be fun. I’m disheartened but not surprised that Keighley didn’t take a harder stance on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and was disappointed we couldn’t see more Replaced because of it.

I thought I’d be more interested in Callisto Protocol but the aggressive focus on gore has turned me off from the game entirely.

Maybe I’m just getting old?
