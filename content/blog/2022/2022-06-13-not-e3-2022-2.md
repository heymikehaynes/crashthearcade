<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://runrunrobot.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Arctic-Awakening-251637-1024x576.jpeg)</figure>I found this weekend of gaming showcases hard to follow and more of a time commitment than I cared to make. However, digging through the news from these events, I found a handful of games that got me excited like horror anthology [The Fridge is Red](https://www.guerrillacollective.com/games/the-fridge-is-red/), survival game [Arctic Awakening](https://arcticawakening.com) that’s being compared to John Carpenter’s The Thing, and a metroidvania-soulslike game called [The Last Faith](https://www.thelastfaithgame.com).

Xbox’s big [Starfield](https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield) gameplay reveal left me disappointed. Between noticeable issues with the demo’s frame rate, to the familiar clunkiness of the Creation Engine (even as a 2.0), I wasn’t super sold as Todd Howard described features that games like No Man’s Sky and Elite: Dangerous have had for years.
