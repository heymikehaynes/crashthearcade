Would Twitter be in [the state it is today](https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/08/elon-musk-not-buying-twitter-sec/) if theyâ€™d consistently enforced their TOS, banned the hate-mongers after their first offences, and not made it such a comfortable place for people like Musk to spew garbage? If the company had any teeth, would he have bothered with the theatrics of buying it?
