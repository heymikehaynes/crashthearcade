[Jordan Devore for Destructoid](https://www.destructoid.com/robocop-rogue-city-fps-gameplay-trailer-release-date-june-2023/):

> It’s hard to adapt a perfect movie into a video game, but they’re going for it. In line with the 1987 movie, OmniCorp has taken control of the Detroit Police Department, and it’s now on RoboCop to clean up the streets by popping scumbags’ heads.

Ignoring the movie for a moment, the perfect RoboCop game already [exists](https://www.robocoparchive.com/games/sega1.htm). Here’s a snippet of a review for RoboCop versus The Terminator on Sega Genesis (not Super Nintendo) from 1994:

> RoboCop vs. the Terminator is 100 percent unapologetically violent. When you blow away an enemy, he rips apart and his blood gushes like water, and running around blowing away Terminators and such is just about all you do.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m excited to play Rogue City and, judging by the trailer, the new game looks cool but anyone that thinks they’re going to come in and make a better game than Virgin did in the mid-90s is out of their minds.

Good luck, Teyon, you’re going to need it.
