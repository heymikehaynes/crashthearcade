[Once upon a time, the Deus Ex studio almost made Final Fantasy 15](https://www.pcgamer.com/once-upon-a-time-the-deus-ex-studio-almost-made-final-fantasy-15)

<div class="link_description">This sounds like it could have been amazing. While I wouldn’t say I *hated* Final Fantasy XV, it certainly isn’t a game I’d ever care to go back to. There were some interesting concepts presented in the finished game but they were buried deep under a confusing, convoluted story and uninspired gameplay mechanics.

By the sounds of it, Eidos would have pushed our understanding and expectations of the technical limits in open-world games. In terms of storytelling, I’d expect something with a similar mood and tone as the recent Deus Ex games, both of which I really enjoyed.

With all that in mind, you can’t help but wonder, if they’d been able to see it through, how it would have been received compared to the previous entries in the series. I guess we’ll never really know.
