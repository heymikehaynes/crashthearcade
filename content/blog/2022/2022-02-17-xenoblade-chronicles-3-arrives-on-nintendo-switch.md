[Jenna Lada for Siliconera](https://www.siliconera.com/xenoblade-chronicles-3-heading-to-switch/):

> A new Xenoblade Chronicles game will appear this year. Nintendo announced Xenoblade Chronicles 3 will come to the Nintendo Switch in September 2022.

While most were hoping for an update on the Breath of the Wild sequel at last week’s Nintendo Direct, this was the announcement that got me most excited.

In early February, news spread that Monolith Soft’s website had [gotten a refresh](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/shtk75/monolith_soft_updatedrenovated_their_website/), prompting many to assume a new Xenoblade was on the way. Though I don’t think anyone was expecting it this soon.

Details are scarce but Xenoblade 3 will link the first and second games, something they did late in XC2. Who knows if we’ll see any original characters return but, since the game arrives in September, we won’t have to wait long.
