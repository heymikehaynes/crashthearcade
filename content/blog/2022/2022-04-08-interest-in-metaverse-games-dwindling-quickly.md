[Jordan Middler for VGC](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/despite-huge-investment-metaverse-games-are-reportedly-struggling-to-retain-players/):

> Despite the high level of investment by companies around the world, metaverse games are struggling to retain players, according to a new report. As compiled by Coin Desk, metaverse titles are struggling to provide players with reasons to continue to engage with the game.

Making games of any sort is hard.

Now imagine, in the case of a game like Axie Infinity, that there are dozens of Pokemon-like, collectible monster games available, ones that don’t use NFTs or any other “web3” technology. They don’t require crypto wallets, a Binance account, Etherium or anything like that. Players install the game, sign in, and start playing. If they decide to spend money in-game, they use established methods of payment, something that’s familiar, reliable, and easy to use.

Considering all these options vying for a player’s attention, is it any wonder why they wouldn’t spend an extended period of time playing NFT games?
