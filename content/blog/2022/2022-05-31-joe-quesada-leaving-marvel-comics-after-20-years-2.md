While I wasn’t a fan of all his [ideas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man%3A_One_More_Day), I appreciated many things he did during his tenure like launching the Ultimate line, green-lighting events like Civil War, Secret Invasion, and Siege to name a few, and reverting long-running books to legacy numbering.

Best of luck, Joe.
