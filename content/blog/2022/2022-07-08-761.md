# [Musk expected to take “drastic action” to break Twitter deal, report says](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/07/musk-expected-to-take-drastic-action-to-break-twitter-deal-report-says/)

You mean to tell me that the shitlord who trolled the entire world by pledging he’d [end world hunger](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/18/tech/elon-musk-world-hunger-wfp-donation/index.html) is abandoning a harshly thrown together Twitter takeover plot to avoid SEC scrutiny and regulatory fines?

Get the fuck outta here.
