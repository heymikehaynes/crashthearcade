I’ve been using [AniList](https://anilist.co/user/runrunrobot/) and [Comic Geeks](https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/profile/runrunrobot/reading) again lately to keep track of my reading and watching. They’ve been a huge help in keeping me on track and making sure I’m not reading or watching stuff twice.
