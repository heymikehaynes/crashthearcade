[Joe Quesada](https://twitter.com/JoeQuesada/status/1531669411467120640?s=20):

> It’s both exciting and bittersweet that after discussions with both my family and my family at Marvel, after two plus decades (has it really been that long?), the time has come for me to move on. As you can imagine, my love for the company, its characters, and all my coworkers runs deep, but I have an exciting new chapter that’s about to begin, so the time feels right.

I have a bit of a sentimental attachment to Quesada’s work since he was running things at Marvel when I got back into comics in 2005.

While I wasn’t a fan of all [his ideas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man%3A_One_More_Day), I appreciated many things he did during his tenure like launching the Ultimate line, green-lighting events like Civil War, Secret Invasion, and Siege to name a few, and reverting long-running books to legacy numbering. Best of luck, Joe.
