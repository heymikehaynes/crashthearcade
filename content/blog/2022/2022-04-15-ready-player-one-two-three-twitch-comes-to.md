> We are launching Twitch embeds on web! Simply select the video post option on your dashboard, grab the embed link from the stream you want to share, and paste it into the “Add video from web” field. Click “Post,” and the stream will appear magically on…your post, duh. If you’re a Twitch streamer, you might boost your audience and even make a little pocket money broadcasting here on Tumblr. If you like watching Twitch but want to do more of that from the comfort of your Tumblr dash, well, now you can. So, giddy up: we hope your consoles are on and your headsets poised.

Exciting news!

In my opinion, Tumblr’s never been overly optimized for promoting or watching streams. Hopefully this update changes that. 🤞🏻
