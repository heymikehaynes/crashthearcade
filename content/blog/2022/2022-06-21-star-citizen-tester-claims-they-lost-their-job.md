# [Star Citizen tester claims they lost their job after ‘requirement to end remote working’](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/star-citizen-tester-claims-they-lost-their-job-after-requirement-to-end-remote-working/)

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://runrunrobot.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/cloud-imperium-games-1024x576.jpeg)</figure>> *Kiplan Case, who according to their LinkedIn profile was a tester at Cloud Imperium’s Austin, Texas studio until recently, claimed this month that their team were “being forced to return to the office” after the company allegedly ditched its vaccine and remote work policies.*

Why are companies like Cloud Imperium Games so hellbent on making employees pay the price for buying or renting gigantic, expensive offices across multiple continents?

In my experience, employees are productive when they feel safe, comfortable, trusted, and valued by their employer. They’re more focused and passionate about the work they’re doing, which ultimately leads to a better product.

Besides, if the [numerous controversies](https://www.denofgeek.com/games/every-star-citizen-controversy/) around Star Citizen’s troubled development are any indication, including reports from 2015 of harassment towards employees by company executives, remote work should be the least of Chris Roberts’ concerns.
