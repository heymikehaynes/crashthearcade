[Jonathan Bolding for PC Gamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/square-enix-president-knows-people-who-play-to-have-fun-dislike-nfts-but-he-wants-them-anyway/):

> \[SE President Yosuke Matsuda\] is unreservedly enthusiastic about the idea that “token economies” will provide those who ‘play to contribute’ with an explicit incentive beyond “such inconsistent personal feelings as goodwill and volunteer spirit.”

People that create in-game content can be rewarded in ways that don’t involve NFTs. Why not exclusive DLC or, you know, *actual money*?

NFTs today bring nothing to the table but add a layer of complexity to existing systems we’ve been using for years. This is just another way for a billion dollar company to “reward” creators by spending as little money as possible. It’s sad to see.
