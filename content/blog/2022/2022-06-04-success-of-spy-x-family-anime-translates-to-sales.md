But according to Shueisha manga editor Shihei Lin, in the short two-month span that the series has been out, sale trajectories have almost doubled, reaching more than 21 million.

I’ve had one hell of a time tracking down volume three of the series but otherwise it’s pretty impressive how readily available the SPY x FAMILY books have been in my local bookstores. I’m hopeful that, beyond the continued success of the books, the series has gotten people into reading manga that hadn’t given them a look before now.
