This is great news. I’m happy to see the studio and  
creators involved in Lesser Evils are as responsive to [feedback](https://runrobot.run/post/685422690231779328/lesser-evils-universe-awa-launching-comics-short) as they  
are interested in pushing the boundaries of what (and where) comics can be.

Following the above update, I read [Emmett](https://globalcomix.com/c/lesser-evils) and enjoyed it. The story was my kind of weird and I really liked Yishan Li’s art. As a digital-first comic, I appreciated how easy it was to read on a computer screen and would be interested in watching the short film too.

Based on my experience with Lesser Evils so far, I’m going to try Thriftr whenever it’s released. The idea of a supernatural story wrapped around the wacky world of startups has me interested.

If AWA decided to do something in place of NFTs for supporters, I would consider it. It’s important to help make comic book projects like these successful, there simply aren’t enough of them.
