# [Resident Evil 4 Remake Will Have a Reimagined Storyline](https://www.siliconera.com/resident-evil-4-remake-will-have-a-reimagined-storyline/)

> The website states that the Resident Evil 4 remake will see a reimagined storyline, it will also feature more modernized gameplay elements. However, Capcom has yet to reveal how any of this will manifest.

RE4 wasn’t a *bad* game, but it’s certainly not my [favourite](https://www.igdb.com/games/resident-evil-2). If they’re reworking the story, maybe some of the [goofier aspects](https://youtu.be/ZSFPracrugU?t=58) will get tossed to keep all the recent remakes a little more consistent.
