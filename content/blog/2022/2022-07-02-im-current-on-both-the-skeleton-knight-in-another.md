I’m current on both the [Skeleton Knight in Another World](https://anilist.co/manga/98900/Skeleton-Knight-in-Another-World/) and [SPY x FAMILY](https://anilist.co/manga/108556/SPY-x-FAMILY/) mangas which seems crazy considering I haven’t been up-to-date on an American comic book in what seems like forever.
