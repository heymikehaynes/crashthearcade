[Rich Johnston for Bleeding Cool](https://bleedingcool.com/comics/valiant-goes-all-in-on-nft-and-metaverse-web-3-0-maybe-comics-too/):

> To launch their debut into the metaverse, Valiant will be unveiling a 3D Genesis Mint Pass token granting access to the first season of character NFT drops \[with an exclusive bonus yet to be revealed\], set to launch January 26th, on the Ethereum blockchain.

If the announcement itself wasn’t disappointing enough, there’s definitely some questionable interaction with the company’s [announcement tweet](https://twitter.com/ValiantComics/status/1483897877491593219?s=20).

As other replies point out, many of the people commenting positively have no history of interacting with Valiant and their behaviour and language is weirdly consistent between each of them. Most follow a handful of crypto related accounts and spam hashtag filled replies to them. These users even interact with Valiant’s post the same, referring to it as a “project”, *three* emoji after their message, “LFG”.

I’m not saying that Valiant is *paying* for good interaction, but bigger companies than them have announced their intentions to release NFTs and move towards whatever they believe Web3 is only to be bombarded by disapproval from their communities.

The majority of people don’t want this crap. I don’t believe for one second that Valiant is the exception to that.
