I’ve tried for years to understand the fascination people have, myself included, with [Dragon’s Dogma](https://www.dragonsdogma.com/en-us/) and always come up empty. Is it an amazing, original game? Not at all, but there’s a certain  
bland, open-world charm to it that I somehow haven’t found in other games.

Every year or so, usually when Capcom decides it’s time to release it on a new platform, I jump back into the game and have a blast casually taking down giant beasts and exploring dungeons I’d long forgotten about before ultimately shelving it again.

Might be time to pick it back up.
