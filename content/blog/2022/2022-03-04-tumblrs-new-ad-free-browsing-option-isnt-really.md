[@kedreeva](https://kedreeva.tumblr.com/post/677209640525840384/i-went-ahead-and-signed-up-for-the-ad-free):

> I AM giving Tumblr a $40 donation as a thank you for 10+ years of free service, the friends I have made along the way, the experiences I’ve earned here, the people I get to interact with, the sometimes functional website, the thousands of my posts they archive and host, and in the hopes it will stick around to continue to do all of that and more.

This is a great post.

I also subscribed to the ad-free option because, frankly, I enjoy <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Tumblr</span> that hellsite. I’ve been using it for over a decade and have never had the option to directly [support the site](https://photomatt.tumblr.com/post/677131859491274752/because-it-cant-lose-money-forever-if-you-use) in any way until now.
