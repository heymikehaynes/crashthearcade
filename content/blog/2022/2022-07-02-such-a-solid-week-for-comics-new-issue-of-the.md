This was such a solid week for comics. New issue of [The Silver Coin](https://imagecomics.com/comics/series/the-silver-coin), great debuts for [Mindset](https://www.vaultcomics.com/sneak-peek-mindset-1/) and [Public Domain](https://imagecomics.com/comics/series/public-domain). Itâ€™s going to be tough to top this one.
