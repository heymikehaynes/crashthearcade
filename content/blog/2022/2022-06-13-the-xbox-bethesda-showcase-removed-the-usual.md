# [The Xbox &amp; Bethesda showcase removed the usual hype, but added some uncertainty](https://www.pcgamer.com/the-xbox-and-bethesda-showcase-removed-the-usual-hype-but-added-some-uncertainty/)

> During the Xbox Games Showcase in 2020, Microsoft announced the return of Fable with a vague minute-long teaser, and revealed Avowed and State of Decay 3 with trailers that weren’t much more detailed. That same year, Microsoft dropped a cinematic trailer for Perfect Dark during The Game Awards. None of them were close to being finished, and none of them have come out yet.

I’ve struggled over the past couple years to understand what exactly the teams that make up Microsoft Studios are actually working on and, most importantly, when/if we’ll see the results of all the money spent buying up game studios.

Nice to see, albeit concerning, that I’m not alone.
