[Andy Robinson for Video Games Chronicle](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/resident-evil-producer-says-currently-no-plans-for-code-veronica-remake/):

> Speaking to website Noisy Pixel, series producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi said that there were no concrete plans to develop a Resident Evil Code: Veronica Remake, but didn’t totally rule out the opportunity, stating that if the “opportunity comes, maybe.

I’ve felt for a while that if any of the games could benefit from a remake, it’s Code Veronica. Capcom’s decision to remake 4 makes financial sense but the game has been remastered and reworked to death on almost every platform imaginable. Do we need a top-to-bottom remake of it?

Why not give a whole new audience a way to experience one of the more under-appreciated entries in the series instead?
