# [How Resident Evil 4 Remake’s Scarier Visuals Hurt the Original’s Campy Charm](https://www.denofgeek.com/games/resident-evil-4-remake-scary-graphics-comparison-original-campy/)

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://runrunrobot.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/leon-resident-evil-4-1024x576.jpeg)</figure>> *\[RE4\] dives headfirst into the campiness, and every character is in on the joke. One of the main villains is even a diminutive nobleman who cackles like a maniac and tries to kill Leon with death traps that include a giant walking statue of himself.*

Ironically, this is the reason why I never enjoyed RE4 as much as most people. It’s a great action game but, in my opinion, a bad Resident Evil game. I’ve never felt like it fit in with the previous games because of the cheese and Leon’s whole “cool guy” shtick.

My hope for the remake is that it sticks significantly closer to the recent ones for 2 and 3 in look and feel, ditches the cheesiness of the original version, and leans harder into the psychological horror.
