[Patch 1.5 &amp; Next-Generation Update](https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/41435/patch-1-5-next-generation-update-list-of-changes)

<div class="link_description">What an absolute **monster** of a patch. I originally finished Cyberpunk 2077 on PC (female V, romanced Judy, and sided with the Aldecaldos) and avoided most of the more glaring issues people were having on consoles.

Now that it’s been thoroughly patched and updated for current-gen systems, I’m going to give it another play through on PlayStation 5. I’d love to experience the game in higher fidelity as my PC hardware is starting to show its age and the game is currently [half-price](https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/games/cyberpunk-2077/).
