[Xbox ‘turned Marvel down’, leading to Spider-Man on PS4, exec reveals](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-turned-marvel-down-leading-to-spider-man-on-ps4-exec-reveals/)

I had always assumed, semi-familiar with rights Sony has to Spider-Man in film, that the series’ exclusivity on PlayStation was a result of that partnership with Marvel. I suppose this explains why, after seeing the success of Spider-Man, Marvel is working with Sony again on the [Wolverine](https://youtu.be/Zcj9AzHv_l8) game.
