# [Morbius Returns to Theaters, Bombs Again at the Box Office](https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/morbius-box-office-bombs-theaters-return/)

> It looks like the movie only grossed $85,000 on Friday. That’s a wild number and projections have it only pulling in $280,000 over the weekend according to Forbes. Memes have been exploding around Morbius for almost two weeks now. But, it’s clear the jokes might not be leading to the massive stampede to theaters that Sony might have been banking on.
