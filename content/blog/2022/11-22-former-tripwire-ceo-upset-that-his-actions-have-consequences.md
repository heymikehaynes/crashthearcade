If he thinks being cancelled by “social terrorism” is bad, just wait until he hears some of the stories of women that, because of the ban he voiced support for, were forced into life-threatening deliveries, knowingly gave birth to stillborn babies, or delivered children fathered by their rapists.

I’m sick of old dudes blaming everyone else when, publicly and unprompted, they share their awful opinions and suffer consequences for it. Often these are issues, as is the case here, that don’t affect them (men) in the slightest but have life-altering consequences for others (women).
