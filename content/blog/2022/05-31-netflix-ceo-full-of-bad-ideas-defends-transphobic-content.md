What a dumbass.

Customers aren’t seeing the value ($10–21 CAD per month) in the firehose of exclusive, mediocre (at best) content, and are offended by the transphobic comedy specials. Targeting password sharing and incorporating ads into a budget plan seems like you’re solving the wrong problems, Ted.
