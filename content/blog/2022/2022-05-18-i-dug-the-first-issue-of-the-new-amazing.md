I dug the first issue of the new [Amazing Spider-Man](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Amazing_Spider-Man_Vol_6). I’m encouraged by Zeb Wells’ “back to basics” approach after what I considered to be a pretty disappointing Beyond arc.

It’s always great having JRJR drawing a Spider-Man book. For me, he’ll always be the quintessential Spidey artist.
