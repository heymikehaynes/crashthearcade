I wish more than anything that DC would move on from using art drawn by Jim Lee to promote new events, initiatives, characters, or redesigns.

I want to be clear: Jim Lee is a legend, no question. However, that’s the reason that announcing the company’s relaunches and reboots over and over again with his art has hampered their ability to break out the antiquated shell that’s enveloped the company for so many years.

There’s a lot of baggage there that I don’t think they realize they’re carrying around with them by continuing to do this.
