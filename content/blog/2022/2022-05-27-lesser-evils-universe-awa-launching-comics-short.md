[Lesser Evils Universe: AWA Launching Comics, Short Films, NFTs](https://bleedingcool.com/comics/lesser-evils-universe-awa-launching-comics-short-films-nfts/)

<div class="link_description">Lesser Evils sounds ambitious and exciting until you see that their  
plans needlessly include NFTs which, at best, feel satirical given the  
pop-culture angle of the stories themselves or, at worst, tone-deaf. I’ve enjoyed several series from AWA, and Lesser Evils does sound  
interesting, but I have no desire to support any sort of project that  
pushes NFTs or other “web3″ junk and I’d imagine I’m not alone.
