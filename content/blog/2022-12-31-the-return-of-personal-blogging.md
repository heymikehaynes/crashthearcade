> Watching the demise of Twitter under the helm of Elon Musk has made me nostalgic for the personal blogging days. The decline of Twitter with the current erosion of legacy media has left me thinking we need to bring personal blogging back with a vengeance. \[…\] The biggest reason personal blogs need to make a comeback is a simple one: we should all be in control of our own platforms.

Overall, a great article with tons of motivation for people out there who have never had a personal blog or abandoned one long ago to either get started or get back into it.

As an aside, one of my biggest pet peeves is when people say something needs to return or be “brought back” simply because they weren’t doing it. In this case, blogs don’t need to make a comeback, they never left. *You* need to come back to blogging and, conveniently, it’s never been easier to do that.
