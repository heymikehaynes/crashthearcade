It’s exciting to see John and the team roll out the much-anticipated [new version](https://ghost.org/changelog/4/) of Ghost that includes a new dashboard, optimizations to the subscription UI, updates to the member management tools, and more.

While I’ve moved away from Ghost over the past few months as my needs have changed, for anyone launching a newsletter, building a community around their work, or looking to monetize their content, I can’t recommend it enough.

I wanted to touch on a quietly mentioned part of this release being the refresh they’ve done to the brand itself. If you follow them on social media, it’ll appear subtle but visit the Ghost website, and it’s anything but. I love the vibrant hits of colour, the attitude in the writing, the confidence the new look evokes.
