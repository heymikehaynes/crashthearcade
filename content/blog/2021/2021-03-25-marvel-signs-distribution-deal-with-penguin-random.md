[Brett Schenker for Graphic Policy](https://graphicpolicy.com/2021/03/25/diamond-releases-a-statement-regarding-marvels-move-to-penguin-random-house/):

> Marvel announced an exclusive deal with Penguin Random House to distribute their comics to the direct market. This is a major hit to Diamond Comic Distributors, the current distributor, and comes about 9 months after DC left Diamond.

First DC and now Marvel? Ouch. I could see stores continuing to get their Marvel stock from Diamond as they’ll already be getting stuff from Image, Dark Horse, and other publishers there.

Though you’d think shops would get a better deal or at least one similar to Diamond through PRH so it may make sense to cut out the middle man. Either way, it puts Diamond in a weird spot.
