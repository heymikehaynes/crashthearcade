> Pocket Casts will be joining Automattic, making it easier for podcast fans to discover new content and customize their listening experience.

Interesting portfolio of products [Automattic](https://automattic.com) has been building with these recent acquisitions, like Tumblr, Day One, and now Pocket Casts. I’ve loved Pocket Casts for a long time, it’s nice to see them secure a path to longterm growth and success.
