Stunned to hear about the passing of Ryan Bodenheim. I’ll never forget the first time I read [A Red Mass For Mars](https://www.comixology.com/A-Red-Mass-For-Mars-Vol-1/comics-series/610?ref=c2VhcmNoL2RldGFpbC9kZXNrdG9wL2xpc3Qvc2VyaWVzU2VhcmNoRGV0YWlsTGlzdA), his art was (and still is) next level stuff. He’ll be sorely missed.
