[Dan Greenfield for 13th Dimension](https://13thdimension.com/finally-superman-78-and-batman-89-comics-coming-from-dc/):

> We’ve had Batman ’66 and Wonder Woman ’77 and now DC is finally giving fans what they’ve waited decades for – official comics with new stories based in the worlds of the 1978 Richard Donner/Christopher Reeve Superman movie and the 1989 Tim Burton/Michael Keaton Batman movie, both starting in July.

These two interpretations of Batman and Superman had a huge impact on my childhood so I, like many others, am overjoyed to see them returning with creative teams of this caliber.

I’ve never been much of a modern day Superman fan but Christopher Reeve’s portrayal of the Man of Steel and the memories I associate with that time are unforgettable. I’m not sure they could have gotten a better artist for the book than Wilfredo Torres. His work is timeless, and perfect for this book.

Batman Returns remains one of my favourite childhood films. I can’t remember how many times I must have watched it over the years. Aside from Kevin Conroy, Keaton’s Batman/Bruce Wayne was (and largely still is) the actor I imagine as Batman. It’s so exciting to see Joe Quinones doing the art on this after literal years of amazing Batman ‘89 art [teases](https://twitter.com/search?q=batman%2089%20(from%3Ajoe%5C_quinones)%20until%3A2021-01-01%20since%3A2006-01-01&src=typed%5C_query). Anyone else just wouldn’t have made sense.
