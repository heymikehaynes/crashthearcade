[Sam Machkovech for Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/resident-evil-viii-gets-may-release-date-massive-preview-playable-demo/):

> RE8 will launch on May 7 on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. All platforms will eventually receive a free-download version of its playable demo, named "Maiden," but only PlayStation 5 owners have gotten a release date for said demo: Today.

I’m not sure what to think about Resident Evil Village. On one hand, the game looks beautiful, Lady Dimitrescu is a fascinating, strange new villain, and, if my time with the [Maiden](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0102-PPSA01858_00-DEMOVILLAGE00001) demo for PS5 was any indication, it’ll be scary as hell. On the other hand, aside from the mansion and [another](https://twitter.com/xhunterGamma/status/1271191436550189056?s=20) Chris Redfield, it doesn’t *look* like Resident Evil. None of the hallmarks of the old games are even slightly apparent anymore.

Does that mean it’ll be a bad game? Not at all. I really enjoyed 7 for what it was and the previously mentioned Maiden demo was genuinely creepy. It’s just that, as a fan of the original games who was generally disappointed in the direction of the series after Zero, I’m conflicted.

Assuming I can get my backlog under control by then, I’ll likely give Resident Evil 8 a spin when it’s available in May.
