[Ethan Gach for Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/the-game-awards-wont-take-sides-on-activision-fallout-t-1848158706):

> Despite being one of the most prominent figures in the video game industry, Keighley has so far refrained from calling out the reported years of abuse at one of the biggest gaming companies in the world.

As others online have noted, Geoff was quick to jump to Hideo Kojima’s defence during his exit from Konami years ago and even made a statement about it during the 2015 edition of the show.

Fast forward to today and instead of adding his voice to the conversation, speaking out against the years of abuse claimed by employees at Activision, he’s remained painfully silent, presumably not willing to risk his ability to secure “world premiere” trailers.

I remember him venting his frustrations with Amazon on Twitter while trying to [pre-order](https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1307029165279862784?s=20) a PlayStation and now, when it’s something that actually matters, he’s silent.

Saying *nothing* says *something*.
