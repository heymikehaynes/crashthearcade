> Apple has discontinued its original HomePod after four years. It says that it will continue to produce and focus on the HomePod mini, introduced last year.

While I understand the first generation had its faults, I’ll be sad to see it go. The Mini is an amazing little device but it can’t come close to the sound quality of the larger HomePod.
