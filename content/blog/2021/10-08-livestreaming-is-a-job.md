> It’s understandable that these streamers aren’t particularly mad—with rough subscriber counts easily accessible and most viewers already being aware of their wealth, there’s not exactly much for them to be angry about.

I haven’t heard of many creators upset about this news but some viewers seem to have taken issue with finding out how much their favourite creators make, despite estimates of these amounts being available for years via sub counts.

While many think of content creators as people just having fun, playing games on stream, the reality is that they do this to make a living and pay the bills. They’re essentially businesses, with mod teams, designers, editors, etc that we support by watching, subscribing to, donating to, etc.

It seems a little backwards to be upset when we find out we’ve helped make them financially successful, no?
