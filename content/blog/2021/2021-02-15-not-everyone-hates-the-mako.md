[Luke Winkie for IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/why-some-mass-effect-fans-want-to-keep-the-original-mako):

> Most people today regard the Mako as one of the hilariously botched eccentricities in the Mass Effect series. At the time, BioWare was still working out the vehicle’s design kinks, and the Mako seemed to handle like it was simultaneously 1,000 tons of futuristic steel but also as light as a feather. Even the mildest of intergalactic speed bumps were enough to send it flying.

I’ve never understood the hate people have for the Mako. I can say with complete sincerity that I enjoyed driving it in the original Mass Effect. Seriously.

Is the experience perfect? Not even close. Is it passable? Sure. Other, more iconic vehicles suffer from similar issues and aren’t ever held to the same standard. I mean, have you driven the Warthog from the original Halo?
