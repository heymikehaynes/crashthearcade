This is a fantastic analysis by a modern master of the medium. Fraction and Ajaâ€™s run on [Hawkeye](https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/16309/hawkeye_2012_-_2015) was already some of my favourites. Now seeing how much consideration and attention went into a single panel, I have an even deeper appreciation of the work.
