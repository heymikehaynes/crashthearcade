[Adam Bankhurst for IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-avengers-hawkeye-content-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-versions-to-be-shown-next-month):

> Marvel’s Avengers next War Table will take place on February 16, 2021, and it will showcase both Hawkeye and the delayed PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions.

I’m curious how many players will return for the DLC. Having finished the game a couple months back, I don’t think that I’ll go back to it. I was turned off by the bugs, paid cosmetics, and the wait time for the PlayStation exclusive Spider-Man content, which hasn’t arrived.

I’m sure the game will look great on the new consoles but there are foundational, functional issues with the game that appear to be getting overlooked in favour of aesthetics.
