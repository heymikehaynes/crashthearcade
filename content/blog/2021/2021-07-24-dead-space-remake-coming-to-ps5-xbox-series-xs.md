[Tom Ivan for VGC](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dead-space-remake-confirmed-for-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/):

> Fans will experience an improved story, characters, gameplay mechanics and more as they fight to survive a living nightmare aboard the desolate mining starship, the USG Ishimura, all while uncovering the dreadful mystery of what happened to the slaughtered crew and ship.

Dead Space will always have a special place in my heart. It’s one of the few games I’ve ever bought on a whim, having heard nothing about the development or release, based simply on the title and box art, that ended up being one of my favourite games ever.

The original Dead Space is nothing short of a masterpiece in survival horror, UI design, and character development. I’m hopeful that Motive will be able to recapture many of those aspects as the later games, specifically DS3, lacked them entirely.
