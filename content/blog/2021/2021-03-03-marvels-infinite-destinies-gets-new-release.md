[Marvel’s Infinite Destinies gets new release dates, creators](https://www.comicsbeat.com/marvel-infinite-destinies-annuals-rescheduled/)

<div class="link_description">I know I sound like a broken record at this point but I’m discouraged to see Black Cat spinning from one event to another so quickly into a new volume. Not to mention how outrageous it is that she seems to be stealing the Infinity Stones of all things. Felicia’s always been a [favourite](https://panelspixels.tumblr.com/tagged/black-cat) of mine because of her history with Spider-man but I’ve never felt like she’s been given stories in the modern era that further develop her character. Placing her into event after event is, in my opinion, doing damage to not only this volume of the book but to the longterm appeal and success of the character.
