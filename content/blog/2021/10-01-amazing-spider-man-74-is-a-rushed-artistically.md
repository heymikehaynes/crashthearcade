[Amazing Spider-Man #74](https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/comic/8941025/the-amazing-spider-man-74) is a rushed, artistically disjointed, and confusing end to Nick Spencer’s run on the title.

Between the Kindred arc that lasted too long, the lackluster Chameleon Conspiracy that came before it, and the frivolousness of Sinister War, I can’t help but feel like his heart wasn’t in it anymore.
