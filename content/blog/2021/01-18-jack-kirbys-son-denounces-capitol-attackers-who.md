[Neal Kirby via Comics Beat](https://www.comicsbeat.com/jack-kirbys-son-denounces-capitol-attackers-who-wore-captain-america-symbols/):

> "These images are disgusting and disgraceful. Captain America is the absolute antithesis of Donald Trump. Where Captain America is selfless, Trump is self-serving. Where Captain America fights for our country and democracy, Trump fights for personal power and autocracy. Where Captain America stands with the common man, Trump stands with the powerful and priveleged. Where Captain America is courageous, Trump is a coward. Captain America and Trump couldn’t be more different.”
