[Popular Podcast App Pocket Casts Joins Automattic](https://wordpress.com/blog/2021/07/16/popular-podcast-app-pocket-casts-joins-automattic/)

<div class="link_description">Interesting portfolio of products [Automattic](https://href.li/?https://automattic.com) has been building with these recent acquisitions, like Tumblr, Day One, and now Pocket Casts. I’ve loved Pocket Casts for a long time, it’s nice to see them secure a path to longterm growth and success.
