By and large, the [Demon’s Souls](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/demons-souls/) remake is the beautiful, terrifying return to Boletaria that I hoped it would be. For returning players, Demon’s Souls will feel almost identical to the FromSoftware classic. Sure, Bluepoint has overhauled the visuals, music, and made much needed adjustments to the controls but the core game remains unchanged.

Unfortunately, that’s one of my biggest gripes with the remake. Given the chance to make changes to the world or lore of the game, short of a few new items and weapons, they opted to keep the game’s world true to the original. It’s understandable, given the desire by many for a pure recreation of the PS3 version, but still disappointing. It would have been nice to see the [elusive](https://demonssouls.fandom.com/wiki/Archstones) sixth archstone finally make an appearance.
