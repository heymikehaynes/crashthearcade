I’ve been spending the past couple of nights building a [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk) with my Raspberry Pi 4. I was able to pair my extra bluetooth Xbox One controller to it, download all the game meta data, and link my Retro Achievements account. It’s nice having something to play the classics on.
