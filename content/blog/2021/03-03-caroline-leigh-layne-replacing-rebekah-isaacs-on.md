[Graphic Policy](https://graphicpolicy.com/2021/03/03/vault-announces-caroline-leigh-layne-as-new-artist-on-money-shot/):

> Vault Comics has announced that Caroline Leigh Layne is the new regular artist on the hit ongoing series, Money Shot. Layne’s run on the sexy sci-fi series will debut with Money Shot #11, the beginning of the series’ third arc.

Rebekah Isaacs has been a force on Money Shot since its debut. While I’m sad to see her go, I’m also excited to see what Caroline Leigh Layne will bring to the book. Her art looks fun and will play well with Seeley and Beattie’s writing.
