[700 Characters: Rockstar Games fans are sick and tired of all the hackers](https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/2/22262564/gta-online-red-dead-online-hackers-rockstar-mod-menus-cheats-community-controversy)

<div class="link_description">The last time I played Grand Theft Auto Online on PC, the experience was awful. Dozens upon dozens of cars randomly spawning on top of me, airplanes falling out of the sky onto my vehicle, moving servers to have it all happen again and again, etc. Eventually, my friends and I closed the game, uninstalled it, and haven’t touched it since. The worst part is that, by the sounds of it, we got off lucky. What’s alarming to me is how casually and consistently Rockstar is willing and able to get new paid content into the game but refuses to do any meaningful work to rid the game of hackers. It’s insulting that they would encourage customers to spend actual money on an online game that’s in as poor a state as theirs is. Shame on them.
