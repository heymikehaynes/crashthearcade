I enjoyed [Casual Fling](https://awastudios.net/series/casual-fling/), my first foray into AWA. Starr’s writing is solid, the dialogue feels natural, and Talajic’s art matches beat-for-beat with clean lines full of emotion. The psychological story they’re setting up has me interested so I’ll keep reading.
