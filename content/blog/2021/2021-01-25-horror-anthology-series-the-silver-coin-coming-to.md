[Graphic Policy](https://graphicpolicy.com/2021/01/22/all-star-comic-creators-tell-us-the-cost-of-the-silver-coin-starting-in-april/):

> Eisner Award-winning artist Michael Walsh will team up with an all-star lineup of collaborators—Chip Zdarsky, Kelly Thompson, Ed Brisson, and Jeff Lemire—in The Silver Coin. This ongoing horror anthology series will launch from Image Comics this April.   
>    
> Each issue of The Silver Coin will tell a tale of terror in a shared supernatural world interwoven with common characters and overlapping stories. The series begins in 1978 with a failing rock band whose fortune suddenly changes when they find the mysterious Silver Coin. Little do they know that fame comes with a cost, and a curse is always hungry.

The creators on this are so good, each bringing their own experiences from not only the horror genre but suspense, crime, and more. I can’t wait to check it out, especially after reading Walsh’s recent work on [The Sleep Stories](https://thesleepstories.com).

It’s nice to see more of these anthology series starting to take off, similar to James Tynion IV and Steve Foxe’s work on Razorblades. They’re a nice change of pace from the serialized, continuity-heavy superhero titles we see every month and I’ll never turn down more horror books from Image.
