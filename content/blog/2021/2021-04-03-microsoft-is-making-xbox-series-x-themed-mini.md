[Patrick O’Rourke for MobileSyrup](https://mobilesyrup.com/2021/04/02/microsoft-actually-building-xbox-mini-fridge/):

> Following a Twitter brand competition that saw Xbox take top honours, Microsoft’s Aaron Greenberg, the company’s Xbox game marketing general manager, says that Microsoft will “move forward” with releasing an Xbox Series X mini fridge.

The fridge thing was good for a laugh at first, especially with how well the Xbox team embraced the memes that were going around, but it’s getting a bit *tired*. Do people still find it funny?
