[GG on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheGGApp/status/1384987011426234376):

> In recent months the mod team has found that our community has grown too large for Discordâ€™s functionality, and have been looking for the best course of action to stay organized.

The number of members in the GG Discord, as of this writing, is 970 with roughly 250 users online at any given time. For comparison sake, the Minecraft Discord server has 700k members, the maximum that the app allows for, with around 150k online. Discord is built to support communities considerably larger than GG.

This is a bad move and one that worries me when considering how future decisions and changes are made within GG itself. Rather than uprooting the entire community and forcing users to switch apps, add a couple more mods to Discord and tidy up the existing channels to keep things under control.
