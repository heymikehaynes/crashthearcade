[700 characters: Ghost 4.0](https://ghost.org/changelog/4/)

<div class="link_description">It’s exciting to see John and the team roll out the much-anticipated new version. While I’ve moved away from Ghost over the past few months as my needs have changed, I can’t recommend it enough to people launching a newsletter, building a community around their work, or looking to monetize their content, especially with the new $9/mo plan announced today. I wanted to touch on a quietly mentioned part of this release being the refresh they’ve done to the brand itself. If you follow them on social media, it’ll appear subtle but visit the Ghost website, and it’s anything but. I love the vibrant hits of colour, the attitude in the writing, the confidence the new look evokes. I’m interested to see how it will evolve in future updates.
