[Zack Quaintance for The Beat](https://www.comicsbeat.com/scott-snyder-comixology-originals-deal/):

> Writer Scott Snyder has signed a deal with comiXology Originals that will see him and a set of collaborators both new and old publish eight titles on the platform ahead of physical releases from Dark Horse Comics.

The talent on these books is *insane*.

It’s great to see the various partnerships that Snyder has built over the years at DC and Image evolving into a project of this scale, it’s one hell of a next chapter for his studio, Best Jackett Press.

There really is a bit of something for everyone here but I’m particularly excited for [Barnstormers](https://href.li/?https://www.bestjackettpress.com/html/barnstormers.html) with Tula Lotay, [Night of the Ghoul](https://href.li/?https://www.bestjackettpress.com/html/night-of-the-ghoul.html) with Francesco Francavilla, and [Clear](https://href.li/?https://www.bestjackettpress.com/html/clear.html) with Francis Manapul. Each project feels tailor-made for the creators involved, I can’t wait.
