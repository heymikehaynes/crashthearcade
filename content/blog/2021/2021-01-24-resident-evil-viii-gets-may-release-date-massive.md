[Resident Evil VIII gets May release date, massive preview, playable demo](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/resident-evil-viii-gets-may-release-date-massive-preview-playable-demo/)

<div class="link_description">I’m not sure what to think about Resident Evil Village. On one hand, the game looks beautiful, Lady Dimitrescu is a fascinating, strange new villain, and, if my time with the [Maiden](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0102-PPSA01858_00-DEMOVILLAGE00001) demo for PS5 was any indication, it’ll be scary as hell. On the other hand, aside from the mansion and [another](https://twitter.com/xhunterGamma/status/1271191436550189056?s=20) Chris Redfield, it doesn’t look like Resident Evil. None of the hallmarks of the old games are even slightly apparent anymore.

Does that mean it’ll be a bad game? Not at all. I really enjoyed 7 for what it was and the previously mentioned Maiden demo was genuinely creepy. It’s just that, as a fan of the original games who was generally disappointed in the direction of the series after Zero, I’m conflicted.

Assuming I can get my backlog under control by then, I’ll likely give Resident Evil VIII a spin when it’s available in May.
