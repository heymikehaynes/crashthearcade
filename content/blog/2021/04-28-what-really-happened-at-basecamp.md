[Casey Newton for The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406673/basecamp-political-speech-policy-controversy):

> Discussion about the [racist list of customer names] and how the company ought to hold itself accountable for creating it led directly to CEO Jason Fried announcing Tuesday that Basecamp would ban employees from holding “societal and political discussions” on the company’s internal chat forums.

Why acknowledge and learn from your mistakes when you can just ban people from ever talking about them? I've never understood the hype of Basecamp, neither the software or the founders. It honestly sounds like a pretty shitty place to work.
