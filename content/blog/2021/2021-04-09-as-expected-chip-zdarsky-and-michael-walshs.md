As expected, Chip Zdarsky and Michael Walsh’s first issue of [The Silver Coin](https://imagecomics.com/comics/releases/the-silver-coin-1) was great. It doesn’t require a huge investment from the reader, as it’s a solid story all on it’s own, but has some connective tissue for readers who’ll be sticking around for the long haul.
