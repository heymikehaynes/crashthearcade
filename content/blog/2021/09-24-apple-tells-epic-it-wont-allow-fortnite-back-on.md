[Chance Miller for 9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/22/apple-tells-epic-it-wont-allow-fortnite-back-on-the-app-store-until-court-verdict-is-final/):

> Apple’s legal team wrote in a notice that Apple will not allow Fortnite back on the App Store until the judge’s ruling is final. That is, until the exhaustion of all court appeals, which could be as long as five years from now.

This makes sense to me. Epic fucked around, and now they're finding out. This does nothing but harm their players, who Sweeney claims to care so much about but then uses as leverage in fights like this.
