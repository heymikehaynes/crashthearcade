[Noelle Warner for Destructoid](https://www.destructoid.com/the-game-awards-need-to-change/):

> I just find it ironic that it’s like “we’re here to celebrate what we love most about gaming” and then it’s all advertisements. Because that’s everyone’s favorite part of games, right? The part where they get you to buy stuff?

Like we saw with the [Spike Video Game Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Video_Game_Awards) years ago, given enough time, even the best ideas can fall apart.
