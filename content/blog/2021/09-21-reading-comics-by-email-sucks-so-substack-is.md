> Turns out, reading comics in an email may not be the best choice so Panels allows them to not only improve the reading experience but also lock it down. Panels is a free comics reader app that uses CBR, CBZ, and PDF formats.

I’ve been using [Panels](https://panels.app) for a long time to read my comics on iPad and, particularly in the past couple years, it’s gotten really good.

In general, I’ve been confused by the Substack comic news. It worries me that we didn’t hear about this partnership with Panels before creators began announcing their deals. I can’t help but feel like this is all being thrown together extemporaneously.
