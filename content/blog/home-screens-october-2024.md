![iPad and iPhone home screens](/uploads/homescreens.png)

I haven't done one of these in a while and figured it was time. I keep my devices fairly tidy so I figured I could get away with covering both my iPhone and iPad. There's also a lot of overlap in the apps but i'll cover some of the reasons why one version may be more helpful on one device than the other.

## **iPhone and iPad**

**Reeder**<br>Reeder is quickly become my everything app. I use it to keep up with my social media, RSS feeds, podcasts, and more. I have it baked into parts of my website as well, like my bookmarks page. It is, without question, my most-used app at the moment.

**Tumblr**<br>Tumblr is by far the social network I've used the longest. Granted, I've deleted my blogs over the years a couple times for various reasons, I've always had at least one running. In terms of art and general absurdity, there's few places better.

**Spotify**<br>I do not like the Spotify app or the company itself. The only reason it's on my home screens is because I have a family plan and use it to listen to music. As mentioned elsewhere on this blog, i'm constantly working to move my family over to Apple Music where they pay artists more, don't pay people like Joe Rogan to host a show, and don't force audiobooks and other crud that I don't want into my ears.

**Arc Search**<br>I stuck with Safari for a long time but switched to Arc on my Mac earlier this year. It took a bit for the sidebar to grow on me, but it has. With that in mind, it only makes sense that I use the Arc Search app on my phone and tablet to keep everything synced up. The app is snappy and well-designed. I like the summarize feature for news articles and the fact that it has a built-in ad-blocker.

**Mail and Messages**<br>I've tried other Mail apps and usually grow bored of the design or features. Apple's app is simple and does the job for me. As for Messages, iMessage is the only messaging service I use besides the occasional Discord chat.

**Apple Passwords**<br>I switched to Apple's password app when it debuted in iOS 18 earlier this year and never looked back. I'd been having progressively more issues with 1Password and, like many other third-party apps, never felt like it properly integrated with the system. Passwords is always there when I need it and, as a big user of the other stock Apple apps, I find the experience familiar and simple.

## iPhone

**Slack**<br>I basically live in Slack for my day job so it feels weird not to have it on the homescreen of my phone.

## iPad

**Panels**<br>The go-to app for reading digital comics and manga, Panels has been a mainstay on my iPad since it launched.

## Widgets

At the moment, I have a smart stack on my phone that shows me the weather, since it changes at a moment's notice here, and calendar to keep track of my work meetings. I've dabbled in them on iPad but, at the moment, I keep things lean and mean.

## Wrap-up

I'd like to do these on a more regular cadence. My home screens don't change that often but they do change. It would be nice to track that somewhere.
