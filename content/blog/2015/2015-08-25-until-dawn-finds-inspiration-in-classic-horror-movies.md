[Andrew Webster for The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/24/9187447/until-dawn-review-playstation-4):

> The best horror movie of the year might just be a video game. Though it’s available on the PlayStation 4, and you play it with a controller, Until Dawn is really as much a film as it is a game; borrowing from some of the biggest horror franchises around, like Saw to Evil Dead, it combines the tropes into a terrifying experience that’s both familiar and unique.

It’s really been too long since we’ve had a decent, truly scary horror game so I’m really excited to fire this one up. In many ways, it’s starting to remind me of [Obscure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscure_(video_game)), a game that originally came out on the PS2. In Obscure, you play as a group of teenagers who are locked inside their school overnight and have to unravel a series of strange events.

Not many people played the game but I really enjoyed the mystery of it and the fact that any character you selected had the potential to be killed without impacting your progression of the story. It simply effected your ending.

I’d love to see Until Dawn defy the odds and become a classic, much like the movies it’s influenced by. While it’s tough to see that happening with such a small marketing push, you never know. Stranger things have happened.
