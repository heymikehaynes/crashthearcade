[Adi Robertson for The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2015/4/28/8509005/ouya-android-microconsole-reportedly-seeking-buyer-debt):

> Embattled gaming company Ouya might be in even more trouble: according to a leaked memo, it’s putting itself up for sale in order to cut back its debt. Fortune reports that Ouya CEO Julie Uhrman sent a memo to investors and advisers earlier this month, saying that the company had failed to satisfy one of its investors’ conditions and that renegotiation over the debt had been unsuccessful.

With PlayStation and Xbox picking up the title titles that were originally exclusive to the Ouya and things like the Nexus Player arriving to bring Android gaming to TVs, the console (and essentially the whole company) has completely served its purpose.

There’s nothing else for them to do.

Beaten on every front, this seems like the only logical step but the big question is who would actually buy them?
