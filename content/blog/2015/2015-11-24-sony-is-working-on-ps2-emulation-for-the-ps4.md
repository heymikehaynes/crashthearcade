[James Vincent for The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/20/9768266/ps4-ps2-emulation):

> What exactly is Sony up to with emulating PlayStation 2 games on the PS4? A report this week from Wired confirmed that the company is, in its own words, “working on utilizing PS2 emulation technology to bring PS2 games forward to the current generation,” but it seems that the PlayStation 4 already has this capability (at least in part), and Sony has done nothing to publicize it.

This far into a new generation of console, do we really need PS2 emulation? There’s more than enough to play on the PlayStation as it stands today.

Couple that with the fact that every studio seems to be re-releasing their older titles as “HD remakes” and I feel like we have signs of not only an industry that’s afraid to take a chance on new IPs but a fanbase that is supporting it.

Replaying all the old games from your childhood past, which in all likelihood the majority of people will try for a brief period of time before switching back to newly released titles, is just that: it’s past. Move on.
