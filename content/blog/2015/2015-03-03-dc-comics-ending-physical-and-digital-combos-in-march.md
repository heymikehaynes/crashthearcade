[Rich Johnston for Bleeding Cool](http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/03/03/dc-comics-to-end-combo-digital-editions-in-march-aside-from-sandman-overture/):

> At the DC Retailer Roadshow on Friday in New York, DC Comics announced they would be ending their digital combo editions, bagged copies of the comic books with a digital download code sold for a dollar over the usual cover price. While sales are low, redemption of the code is far lower, and it seems to be just collected, still bagged, as a variant cover of the original.

Am I the only one who thought this ended months ago? I can’t remember the last time I went to the comic shop and saw a DC book in a bag.

I’m hoping this paves the way for something similar to what Marvel is currently doing with their books. While I can’t see that making huge waves for sales, I’ll certainly push some readers to take a chance on a new book, knowing they’ve got a digital version that can be read on the go.
