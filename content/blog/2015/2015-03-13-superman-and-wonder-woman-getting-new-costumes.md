[Jesse Schedeen for IGN](http://ca.ign.com/articles/2015/03/12/superman-and-wonder-woman-get-new-costumes-in-june):

> A handful of upcoming comic book covers have revealed new costumes for both Superman and Wonder Woman. These costumes will debut in June as part of DC’s major post-Convergence relaunch.

Coming off of the New 52 [redesigns](http://www.toplessrobot.com/2013/08/10_wonder_woman_of_all.php) as well as the [one](http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2010/06/jms-jim-lee-change-wonder-womans-costume-continuity/) for Wonder Woman shortly before that, this feels like it’s too much, too soon. I’m not opposed to Wonder Woman rocking pants but the whole outfit just feels busy, similar to a lot of the initial redesigns for characters when the New 52 began.

On the other end of the spectrum, Superman just looks so incredibly… *plain*. Why take a character, regarded by so many as the definition of a superhero, and make him look so painfully normal?
