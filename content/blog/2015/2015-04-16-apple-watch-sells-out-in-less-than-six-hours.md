[Joe Rossignol for MacRumors](http://www.macrumors.com/2015/04/10/apple-watch-sold-out-launch-day/):

> The stainless steel Apple Watch retained fairly better shipping estimates after the pre-order window opened, with most models available to ship in 4-6 weeks after the first hour of availability.

I suppose that answers the question as to whether or not people would want to actually buy the Apple Watch. Though, if the delayed shipping schedule doesn’t have you convinced, there’s also [this](http://www.macrumors.com/2015/04/12/apple-watch-1-million-preorders-us/).

To put that into perspective, Android Wear — the app needed to run your Android-based wearable of choice — has been downloaded somewhere between one and five million times since the watches first appeared last year. I’d love to be more accurate but Google has yet to release numbers of units sold.

Pebble took to Kickstarter to sell their new watch. Doing so, they sold roughly 79,000 watches in a month, including one to me. It’s a different league, I get that, but it’s still important to note.

It took Apple less than 24 hours to sell a million watches. Are they reinventing the wheel? Not really. Is it something everyone needs? I wouldn’t say so. It’s an Apple product. That alone gave the watch legs. The company has also done a great job with the marketing of the device as well so that people actually know about it, which is something I feel Google really should have done to make this a fair fight.

That said, maybe Apple’s done the work for them.
