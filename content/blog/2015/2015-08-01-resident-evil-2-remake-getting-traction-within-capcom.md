[Capcom’s “H” via Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2015/7/31/9078733/resident-evil-2-remake):

> Right after the RE HD Remaster project was finished, I actually started putting together my ideas for this “RE2 Project”. So, I just brushed it up and went to see my boss to present the basic concept of the project already …

Resident Evil 2 is my favourite of the series. Period. So, while i’d love to play a scaled up, HD version of the original game, my fingers are crossed for a full blown remake, akin to what we got on Gamecube back in 2002. Several different news outlets today have reported everything from a complete rebuild of the original PS1 game to a simple clean-up so who knows.
