[John Walker for Rock Paper Shotgun](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/07/02/city-of-heroes-retrospective/):

> I stuck with CoH longer than any other MMO, even World Of Warcraft. I’ve never liked an MMO more than it. It felt so fun, so immediate, and I never had a moment where I felt I needed to grind. It had sidekicking to let you play with people of any level. It had a constantly growing roster of super powers. It felt like an MMO that gave, rather than took away.

An incredible game and the first MMO I played that really hooked for longer than just a couple of weeks. Not sure if it was genuinely a great game or that I just associate it with a certain point in my life but i’ll never forget the late nights with friends taking down supervillains.
