[Owen Good for Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2015/9/26/9401451/ps-vita-successor-unlikely-given-mobile-gaming-climate-says-sony):

> Shuhei Yoshida, the worldwide studios chief for Sony Computer Entertainment, told a panel this weekend that “the climate is not healthy” for a successor to the PlayStation handheld, thanks to the saturation of mobile gaming-ready devices and the nature of the games they play.

Not totally surprising but sad nonetheless. Sony was never really able to find their footing in the mobile space within North America.

I’d argue that the company could have certainly competed with the growing number of mobile devices on the market had they taken the necessary steps. What those might be, I’m not a 100% sure and, clearly, Sony isn’t either.
