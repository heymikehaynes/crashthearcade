[Ron Amadeo for Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/12/google-and-ford-reportedly-team-up-to-build-self-driving-cars/):

> Google just found a major partner for its self-driving car program. A report from Yahoo Autos claims that, during CES, Ford will announce a joint venture between it and Google to build self-driving cars.

Similar to how the company handles its Nexus line of phones, it only makes sense to keep the hardware in the hands of people whoâ€™ve been doing it for years and let Google handle the software.

Interesting contrast to how Apple is apparently handling the development of their car project, which is apparently being done entirely in-house but includes former Ford employees amongst others.
