[Dieter Bohn for The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/apple/2015/9/9/9277881/iphone-6s-plus-hands-on-photos-video-camera):

> There’s a consistent use case for 3D Touch: “peeking” into the thing that’s being linked. So you can peek in camera functions from the camera icon, you can peek at an email without opening it from your inbox, and you can peek at a website when somebody sends you a link. I expected that 3D Touch would be a slew of hidden menus and options, but so far Apple is always giving you hints about what you’ll get: a peek into whatever it is you’re pressing on. Smart.

This looks like such a cool feature. I can already imagine many exciting ways to implement on the phone, both by Apple and third-party developers. It’s really nicely implemented on the phone, at least from the coverage I’ve seen of it. Apple’s making it seem pretty enticing to be upgrading on the S cycle.
