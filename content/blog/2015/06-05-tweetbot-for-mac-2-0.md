> Twitter for Mac continues to suffer from its on-again, off-again death. They clearly don’t consider it a first-class citizen compared to the other clients. So I highly recommend the new Tweetbot for Mac 2.0, which I’ve been trying out the past week or so. First-class all the way.

I’ve seen a ton of press for Tweetbot’s OS X version since it launched back in 2012 and it has been overwhelmingly positive. It’d be interesting to see the install numbers for Twitter’s official app which, as Siegler mentions, has been almost completely ignored since it arrived in the Mac App Store several years ago.
