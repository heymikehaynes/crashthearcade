[Alec Meer for Rock Paper Shotgun](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/09/18/mgs-vi):

> Our chums at Eurogamer are lending their trusted backing to recent claims that publisher Konami are beating a swift retreat from big budget land for a while, even though everyone and their D-Dog seems to be playing Metal Gear Solid V.

This confirms the earlier rumours around the time when Silent Hills was canned that Konami was making a [shift](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1046059) into mobile, which they denied at the time.

Really can’t say I blame them. With Metal Gear Solid being arguably the company’s biggest franchise and the series’ mastermind having now left the company, what from Konami could possibly keep them in the same league as other AAA publishers?
