[Andrew Wheeler for ComicsAlliance](http://comicsalliance.com/adam-hughes-real-power-dc-universe-poster/):

> It’s inspired cosplayers and artists alike, and hangs in pride of place on many comic fans’ walls, yet Adam Hughes‘ Real Power of the DC Universe poster was originally just a giveaway at San Diego Comic-Con back in 2008.

Back in 2010, at the inaugural C2E2 event in Chicago, I had a chance to meet Adam Hughes and have him sign this poster, which currently hangs on my office wall.

While we were chatting, he mentioned to me that he had put Catwoman in the poster on his own, without the permission of DC, and hoped that she’d be included in the final version, which she thankfully was. His [post on DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/adamhughes/art/Women-of-DC-91401295) covers the entire story but it was really incredible to hear it right from the man himself.

Because of this story, brought on by his love for the character and his long [history](https://www.google.ca/search?q=adam+hughes+catwoman&espv=2&biw=1440&bih=801&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=KHIkVeyVMIHQsAX9jIHoBw&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ) working on her book, he chose to sign just to the left of her, which he mentioned he does intentionally because of the whole experience.

Meeting him, having this piece signed and hearing this story was one of the highlights of the convention for me and I think about it every time I look at the poster.
