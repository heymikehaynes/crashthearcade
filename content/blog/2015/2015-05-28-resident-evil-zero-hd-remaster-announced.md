[Alice O’Connor for Rock Paper Shotgun](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/05/26/spooky-voice-resident-evil-zero-hd-remaster-announced/):

> Capcom announced this morning that they’re giving the 2002 prequel to Resident Evil the old updatearoo. They say this new version will be a modern update similar to this year’s enhanced REmake.

While I’m excited to see this game getting more exposure, given how much I actually enjoyed it when I last played it all the way through, I do wish they’d finally pull the trigger on either a reboot of the franchise, or a new remake of another title from the early days of series.

Seeing Capcom clean up and remaster these games is certainly encouraging. You’d have to imagine they’ll continue looking long and hard at the numbers when plotting out where to go next with the series. It’s something fans of the series, myself included, should keep in mind when they consider picking up this game.
