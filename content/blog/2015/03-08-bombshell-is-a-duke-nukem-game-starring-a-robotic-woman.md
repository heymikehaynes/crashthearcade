[Chris Plante for The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/4/8145901/bombshell-3d-realms-duke-nukem):

> “It was Duke \[Nukem\] replaced with \[the character\] Bombshell.” The heroine, a former explosives expert named Shelley Harrison, was to play a supporting role in the original Duke Nuke game; when the lawsuit stymied development, the team cut Duke and bumped Bombshell into the lead role.

For the sake of clarification, this was definitely meant to be the next Duke Nukem game. After some (still ongoing) legal issues between the company who created him and the company who now owns him, that game was put on hold and them modified into a new title that starred the Bombshell character.

The game was [previewed](http://youtu.be/COLbJ3FyoKM) in May of 2014 and met with a sea of criticism because of the lacklustre graphics, ankle deep character development and gratuitous shots of the scantly clad main character. Since then, the team at 3D Realms and Interceptor have overhauled the entire game adding more depth, a respectable protagonist — by way of more clothes and a personality — and a story worth playing through.
