[Comicbook.com](https://comicbook.com/news/fantastic-four-sequel-removed-from-foxs-release-schedule/):

> Despite Fox’s initial insistence that the Fantastic Four sequel was moving forward despite the box office failure of the first film, Fox has now officially removed the Fantastic Four sequel from their release schedule.

Can’t say I’m shocked.
