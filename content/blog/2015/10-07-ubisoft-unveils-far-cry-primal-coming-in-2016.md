[Sam Machkovech for Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/far-cry-primal-coming-to-xb1ps4-february-23-pc-in-march/):

> Far Cry Primal will take players to a prehistoric era that, according to today’s new teaser trailer, will be inhabited by saber-tooth tigers and wooly mammoths.
>
>  The teaser showed off rudimentary, handmade weapons like spears and bows, and the game’s announcement mentioned the need to craft other tools, make use of fire for protection, and guard fellow tribespeople.

The parts of Far Cry 4 that I really disliked were the strange, drug-fuelled shangri-la sequences, which disallowed the use of firearms and other forms of combat. Primal seems like it’ll largely lean into that style of game so I’ll be happily sitting this one out.
