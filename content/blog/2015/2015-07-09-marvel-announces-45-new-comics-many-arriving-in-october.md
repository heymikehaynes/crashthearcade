[Jamie Lovett for Comic Book](https://comicbook.com/news/marvel-announces-45-all-new-all-different-series/):

> Today, comic shop retailers across the globe received the All-New, All-Different Marvel Previews, a magazine revealing most of their post-Secret Wars publishing line that will debut in Oct., and it is full of revelations as to the direction of the Marvel Universe.

Right as I feel like I’m completely disconnecting with Marvel, they knock it out of the park. The creative teams and characters that’ll be getting their own books make me wish that Secret Wars was ending sooner just so we didn’t have to wait so long.

A couple highlights from the list:

- Scarlet Witch by Robinson and Wada
- A-Force by Wilson and Ibanez
- All-New All-Different Avengers by Waid, Kubert, Asrar and Ross
- Spider-Man by Bendis and Pachelli
- Invincible Iron Man by Bendis and Marquez
