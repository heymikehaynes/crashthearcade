[Billy Steele for Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-29-google-hangouts-ios-update.html):

> Frustrated with the Google Hangouts app on iOS from time to time? Us too. Mountain View updated the mobile software today with a refreshed UI and more. First, you’ll likely notice the new coat of Material Design paint that tidies things up a bit. Heck, even the dialer got a redesign.

Interesting to see the iOS version of the new Hangouts arrive ahead of Google’s own Android. Although, I’d argue the iOS version has lagged behind for a while now and needed a much larger refresh anyway.

Having played around with the update this afternoon, it’s a very welcome change and brings the experience together nicely when paired with the recently refreshed Hangouts Chrome app.
