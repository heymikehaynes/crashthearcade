[Michael McWhertor for Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2015/8/27/9207599/metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-review-ps4-xbox-one-PC):

> Series creator Hideo Kojima has been making Metal Gear games with publisher Konami for close to 30 years, creating sequels and prequels that bounce back and forth between the future and the past of a labyrinthine fictional world of spies, cold wars and walking nuclear weapons bearing the series’ name. The Phantom Pain, an open-world stealth game about the adventures of Big Boss, also known as Snake, seems to be his unexpected swan song. The Phantom Pain closes the loop on the three decade-long Metal Gear saga and the result, warts and all, turns out to be one of the best entries in the series.

Some seriously high praise from the gaming press this week for what will be a strong contender for Game of the Year.

This all seems fitting, what with this looking like final entry that creator/writer/director Hideo Kojima’s name will be attached to. It feels like this really is the end of an era and it’s nice to see he’ll be leaving the series on a high note.
