[Alex Abad-Santos for Vox](http://www.vox.com/2015/4/16/8438743/batman-superman-dawn-of-justice-trailer):

> “Tell me, do you bleed?” a Batman with glowing eyes asks Superman. The sky is dark and rainy. The city looks like it hasn’t seen the sun in years. And the trailer closes with an ominous promise from Batman. “You will,” he says.

While the trailer doesn’t look terrible, assuming this is legit, it’s certainly a Zack Snyder movie, for better or worse. The whole thing feels like nothing more than a bar fight between two bros with the volume turned way up.

Whereas we had a huge departure, especially in Dark Knight Rises, with what many would consider to be a “traditional” Batman story, this looks like the safest, most cliché route that Warner Bros could take. Hopefully that changes when we see more of it in future trailers.

It seems a little strange to me that they’re hinging an entire movie on the controversial events of Man of Steel, in which Superman’s disregard for the world around him led the destruction of a huge part of Metropolis and the deaths of countless people.

With a ton of movies coming down the pipe, I’m really hoping this works out. I definitely don’t want to see DC fail here but this trailer certainly doesn’t fill me with confidence.
