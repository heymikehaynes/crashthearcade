> With the release of Tizen, Samsung now has two smartphone interface designs under its belt. The company’s other creation is TouchWiz, the skin that ships with all of its Android phones. But for the most part, Samsung has to color inside of Google’s lines there.

Great look at the UI differences between the stock Android experience, Samsung’s TouchWiz skin (which is essentially just layered on top of Android) and the Tizen OS which currently runs their Z1 phone.

It would be interesting to see Google using something like this to steer more people to a stock experience as, unfortunately, most people assume that TouchWiz is the standard Android experience.
