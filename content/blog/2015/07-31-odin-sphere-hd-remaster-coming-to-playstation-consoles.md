[Michael McWhertor for Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2015/7/20/9003985/odin-sphere-hd-playstation-4-ps3-vita-vanillaware-atlus):

> Vanillaware’s side-scrolling, fantasy action-role-playing game Odin Sphere is coming back next year in remastered form, publisher Atlus announced today. Odin Sphere: Leifþrasir, a high-definition re-release, is bound for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in January.

I like the idea of remastering games that many people, myself included, maybe didn’t have a chance to play when they were initially released.

I always heard great things about Odin Sphere and I’m really looking forward to trying it myself after all these years. The game looked gorgeous when it came out, I can only imagine how much better it’ll look in the remaster.
