I’d even go as far as saying that, in a single issue, Doomsday Clock shows it has more of the spirit of the original Watchmen than *almost* all of the Before Watchmen books ever did. The exception being Adam Hughes’ [Doctor Manhattan](https://www.comixology.com/Before-Watchmen-Dr-Manhattan/comics-series/8412).
