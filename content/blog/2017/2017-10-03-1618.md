That redesigned [launcher](https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-new-pixel-2-launcher) on the rumoured Pixel 2 phones looks pretty rough. I’m having trouble understanding the placement of that search bar, which I would constantly be hitting by accident. That said, I do really like the calendar reminders at the top and the removed “G” pill button.
