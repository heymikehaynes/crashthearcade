[Andy Kelly for PC Gamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/alan-wake-is-disappearing-from-steam-after-this-weekend/):

> According to [a tweet](https://twitter.com/remedygames/status/863012017833218049) by Remedy Entertainment, Finnish creator of Alan Wake, its atmospheric horror game will be “removed from stores” (including Steam) on May 15 because of “expiring music licenses.”

If you don’t already own Alan Wake, pick it up before it’s gone. It’s a gem.
