I finally got around to reading [The Belfry](https://www.comixology.com/The-Belfry/digital-comic/464908). If you dug Wytches, check this one out. It’s a solid horror one-shot. I also checked out the first issue of [Black Bolt](https://www.comixology.com/Black-Bolt-2017-1/digital-comic/494327?ref=c2VhcmNoL2luZGV4L2Rlc2t0b3Avc2xpZGVyTGlzdC90b3BSZXN1bHRzU2xpZGVy), which was great. With an interesting story, and incredible art, I’ll definitely keep reading.
