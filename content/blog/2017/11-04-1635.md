Seems like getting the Essential phone just wasn’t meant to be. Telus refuses to sell devices outright, which is news to me. Given how hard it is to get one, since Essential only ships to the US and I am not and will not be a Telus customer, I’m thinking I’ll save my money for the OnePlus 5T instead.
