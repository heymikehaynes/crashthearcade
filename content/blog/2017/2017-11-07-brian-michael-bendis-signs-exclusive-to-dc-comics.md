[Justin Carter for CBR](https://www.cbr.com/brian-michael-bendis-dc-exclusive/):

> Brian Michael Bendis has written for Marvel Comics for nearly 18 years, working on titles ranging from Ultimate Spider-Man and Daredevil to Secret Invasion and Jessica Jones. However, that era is coming to an end this morning with an announcement from DC Comics.
> 
>  In a brief statement on Twitter, the publisher revealed that Bendis has signed a “multifaceted, multilayered” exclusive agreement.

I’m completely floored by this news. I’ll read whatever he’s on just because it’ll feel so abnormal, much like when JRJR started on Superman.
