I just finished Resident Evil 7 and enjoyed it overall. That said, so many of the things it does right are almost completely undone by terribly predictable boss battles. Still, it’s an incredible feat to have re-energized the series after so long, which this game certainly did. It’s likely my favourite entry since the original RE3.
