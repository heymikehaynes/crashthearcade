Still playing catch-up on my comics but finally got to read [Metal #1](https://www.dccomics.com/comics/dark-nights-metal-2017/dark-nights-metal-1). Interesting first chapter that I’m sure will be unlike anything we’ve seen in a Batman book. Snyder and Capullo are a dream team, once again poised to deliver that “big-event” feel. Looking forward to more.
