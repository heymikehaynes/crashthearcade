[Mondo](https://mondoshop.com/blogs/news/the-thing-game-limited-edition-version-with-artwork-by-jock):

> In *The Thing™ Infection at Outpost 31*, relive John Carpenter’s sci-fi cult classic as a hidden identity game designed to push you to the edge. Play as one of a dozen characters like helicopter pilot MacReady, mechanic Childs, or station manager Garry. Face sabotage and infection as you investigate the facility—gather gear, battle The Thing, expose any imitations among you, and escape Outpost 31!

I’m so excited to play this. I’ve never been much of a tabletop player but, as a huge fan of The Thing, I’ll have to grab this. As much as I like Jock’s art, I think i’ll likely get the regular version of the game. The art on it reminds me of the artwork used to promote the movie, which I’ve always loved the design of.
