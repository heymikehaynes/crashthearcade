[Zenless Zone Zero](https://www.igdb.com/games/zenless-zone-zero) is a game I’m excited to play but things have changed recently. During the last round of beta testing, I was banned for trying to run the game on my M1 iMac.

If you’re not aware, one of the stipulations of beta testing ZZZ is that you agree to only install the game on one of each device type: PC, and mobile. You can put the game on your phone or your iPad, not both. You can install the game on a single PC, not two.

When it comes to the iMac, I know that what I’m essentially doing (because there’s no macOS version) is installing the mobile version of the game but it didn’t occur to me in the moment that it would count against my device limit. To me, my iMac is a PC category device. In hindsight, this makes sense from a technical perspective because, again, there’s no macOS version and you’re installing the iOS/iPadOS version, but how do they expect the average person to know this? I like to think I'm fairly tech-savvy but not everyone in the beta is.

Regardless, I installed and ran the game on my iMac and, shortly after trying to run the game and realizing it didn’t support keyboard and mouse, promptly removed it. The next time I logged in, I was greeted with a screen informing me that I’d been banned. After doing some research online and contacting support, it was clear I’d broken the rule around device limits and the ban wouldn’t be lifted.

I mean, I get it but… *really*?

Fast forward to this week and the game is now available for pre-order/pre-registration. On PS5, the game costs $13 (a first for HoYoverse?) and I’m feeling weird about it. I know that, given my excitement for it and experience during the beta, I’m still going to play the game (assuming I’m allowed to?) but I’d be lying if I said this experience hadn’t put a damper on it.
