Some quick thoughts on this whole situation and broader layoffs across the gaming industry. If I’ve missed or misunderstood something, please let me know, I’m happy to be wrong.

- Rocksteady is a studio known for their single-player games
- They were [pushed by management](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/insiders-blame-suicide-squads-failings-on-changing-vision-and-lack-of-live-service-skills) (or higher?) to make a live-service Suicide Squad game to compete with Destiny and LoL
- The development process suffered from lack of experience by devs in making live-service games (see above), mismanagement, and shifting priorities by execs at WB
- SS was delayed several times before finally being released to mixed critic reviews and poor reception from fans of their previous games
- As a direct result of low sales for Suicide Squad, [Rocksteady team members were let go](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rocksteady-reportedly-lays-off-staff-following-suicide-squad-woes)

When are we going to acknowledge that shit like this the fault of people disconnected from the creative process and have them face the consequences? I’m sick of hearing about companies “realigning for success”, or whatever word salad they’re using to justify it this week, while keeping these executives on the payroll.

Fire whichever overpaid SVP made the decision for an award-winning single-player studio to build a live-service game and let the talented people actually creating the games keep their jobs.
