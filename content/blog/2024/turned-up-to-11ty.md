This is a quick update: I've rebuilt my site using&nbsp;[11ty](https://11ty.dev). I'm sorry if you're seeing duplicate entries in your RSS reader.

Over the years, I've tried building&nbsp;something&nbsp;with 11ty a couple of times, but I always hit a roadblock and quickly switched back to Jekyll, WordPress, or something else I was more familiar with. This time, maybe inspired by the&nbsp;[recent drama](https://crashthearcade.com/blog/2024-09-28-thoughts-wordpress-drama/)&nbsp;in the WordPress community, I pushed through and made a thing! I even encountered a few build errors along the way, but I managed to fix them!

One exciting aspect of the site is that [Reeder](https://readerapp.net) powers several feeds, like on the&nbsp;Bookmarks&nbsp;page. After retrieving the feed, a webhook triggers the site to rebuild, ensuring it stays up-to-date. This is great since I've moved more of the content I follow and read into the app.

I will eventually try adding CMS support using&nbsp;[CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com/), but I'm pretty happy with everything now.
