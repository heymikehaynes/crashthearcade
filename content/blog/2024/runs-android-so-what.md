The tech press has been making a huge deal out of the fact that the R1, Rabbit's first AI-powered device, runs Android and I don't understand at all. It’s basically a smartphone; why would they use anything else to run a device like this? It’s still cheaper (though lacking in features) than most Android devices.

Admittedly, I’m bummed about the reception for the R1 so far. I love its design, the hardware (yes, even the orange) and the software. I think the price tag is steep, but not entirely out of line. In many ways, it reminds me of Pebble’s smartwatches, which I was an early adopter of.

I hope Rabbit turns it into something compelling.
