Sony’s [30th anniversary celebration](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/30th-anniversary-collection/) of the original PlayStation rings hollow. Why release nostalgic, PS1-themed controllers and a reskinned console that doesn’t even play PS1 games? And yes, I know they offer the Classic Collection on PS Plus Premium for $23 per month but that's a whole other issue for a different day.

I’ve got a collection of original PlayStation games that straight-up don’t work on the PS5. What’s more, I’ve already repurchased some of these games digitally on the PS3, thinking I'd have access to them for the foreseeable future but no, those didn't even make it to the PS4.

I get this might sound petty, but I’m tired of gaming companies flip-flopping on backwards compatibility. They charge players over and over for the same games, only to drop support entirely after a few years. It's no wonder people turn to piracy. If Sony’s not willing to respect longtime fans and preserve the games that got them to a 30th anniversary in the first place, why should players feel compelled to support Sony by rushing out and buying PS1-themed peripherals?

So, as cool as the idea of a $110 controller in a specific shade of grey with colorful face buttons sounds, I'll pass, thanks.
