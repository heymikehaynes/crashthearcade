Sony’s [30th-anniversary celebration](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/30th-anniversary-collection/) of the original PlayStation rings hollow. Why release nostalgic PS1-themed controllers and a reskinned console that doesn’t even play PS1 games? And yes, I know they offer the Classic Collection on PS Plus Premium for $23 per month, but that’s a problem for another day.

I’ve got a collection of original PlayStation games that straight-up don’t work on the PS5. What’s more, I’ve already repurchased some of these games digitally on the PS3, thinking I’d have access to them for the foreseeable future. But no—those didn’t even make it to the PS4.

I get this might sound petty, but that’s kind of the point. I’m tired of billion-dollar gaming companies flip-flopping on backwards compatibility, charging players for the same games over and over again, only to drop support entirely after a few years. It’s no wonder people turn to piracy. If Sony isn’t willing to respect longtime fans and preserve the games that got them to a 30th anniversary in the first place, why should players feel compelled to support Sony by rushing out to buy PS1-themed peripherals?

So, as cool as the idea of a $110 controller in a specific shade of grey with colorful face buttons sounds—I’ll pass, thanks.
