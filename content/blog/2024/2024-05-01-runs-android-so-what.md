[Ron Amadeo for Ars](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/rabbit-r1-ai-box-is-just-an-android-app-and-the-software-can-run-on-a-phone/):

> Rabbit Inc. is right to use Android, or specifically as much of AOSP as it can. Forget about all the Google Play stuff—if you have something that needs to connect a mobile network, manage charge states, light up a touchscreen, work hardware inputs and a camera, and use an SoC in a power-efficient way, AOSP already does all of this for you.

Yeah, I’m really not sure why the tech press is making a big deal out of the fact that the R1 runs Android. It’s basically a smartphone, why would Rabbit use anything else to run a device like this? It’s still cheaper (though lacking in features) compared to most Android devices.

Admittedly, I’m kind of bummed about the reception for the R1 so far. I love the design of it, both the hardware (yes, even the orange) and software. I think the price tag is steep but not completely out of line. In a lot of ways, it reminds me of Pebble’s smartwatches, which I was an early adopter and supporter of.

I hope Rabbit is able to turn it into something compelling eventually.
