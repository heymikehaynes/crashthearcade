The Browser Company today [announced](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24279020/browser-company-ai-browser-arc) they're working on something *new*. Arc hasn't reached the critical mass they'd hoped but they're keeping it around and taking another shot at it.

Throughout my career, I’ve had projects shut down while searching for market fit, bogged down by restrictive timelines, budget constraints, and misalignment with management. That’s why this shift feels exciting – watching a team actually get the runway they need to create something great.

For me, the Windows release of Arc felt like a turning point. With the focus shifting to bring the Windows version up to speed, major feature releases for Mac naturally slowed. In my opinion, you could see this shift coming.

I understand where Josh is coming from: Arc isn’t going to be everyone’s browser. When I introduced it to some of my family, they just didn’t get it – and that’s fine. Knowing Arc has a stable future, I’m excited to see what they build for everyone else.
