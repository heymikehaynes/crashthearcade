The Browser Company today [announced](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24279020/browser-company-ai-browser-arc) they're working on something *new*. Arc hasn't reached the critical mass they'd hoped so they're taking another shot at it with an entirely new browser that's simpler for the average user to wrap their head around.

Throughout my career, I’ve had projects shut down while searching for market fit, bogged down by restrictive timelines, budget constraints, and misalignment with management. That’s why this shift feels exciting – watching a team get the runway they need to create something.

For me, the Windows release of Arc felt like a turning point. With the focus shifting to bring the Windows version up to speed, major feature releases for Mac naturally slowed. You could see this coming.

I understand where they're coming from: Arc isn’t going to be everyone’s browser. When I introduced it to some of my family, they just didn’t get it – and that’s fine. Knowing Arc has a stable (though maybe not so feature-rich) future, I’m excited to see what they build for everyone else.
