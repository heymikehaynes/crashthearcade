Today, the browser company announced they're working on something *new*. Arc hasn't reached the critical mass they'd hoped for, so they're taking another shot at it with an entirely new browser that's simpler for the average user to understand.

Throughout my career, I've had projects shut down while searching for market fit, bogged down by restrictive timelines, budget constraints, and misalignment with management. That's why this shift feels exciting – watching a team get the runway they need to create something.

For me, the Windows release of Arc felt like a turning point. With the focus shifting to bring the Windows version up to speed, major feature releases for Mac naturally slowed. You could see this coming.

I get it. When I showed it to some of my family, they weren't sold – and that's fine. While I'm nervous that Arc won't get any significant updates or new features, I want to see what's next.
