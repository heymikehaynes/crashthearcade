Robb [posted](https://rknight.me/blog/every-phone-ive-ever-owned/) about the phones he’d owned over the years, and it reminded me of a note I’d started a while back and never finished, chronicling all the devices that have occupied a place inside my pocket.

I know the timelines of some of these are blurry, and I’m confident I’m missing a couple somewhere in there, but I think I got most of them. I’m ignoring all the pre-smartphone devices I’ve owned, but for the record, my first phone was a Nokia 6110.

These are as chronological as possible.

## "Smart" phones

* Blackberry Curve (8310)
* Blackberry Storm (9530)
* iPhone 3GS
* iPhone 4

## (Mostly) Android phase

* Samsung Galaxy Note 3
* Nexus 4
* Nexus 5
* OnePlus One
* Moto X (1st generation)
* iPhone 5
* iPhone 6 Plus
* Nexus 6
* Nexus 5X
* Nexus 6P

## The big iPhones

* iPhone 7 Plus
* Nextbit Robin
* OnePlus X1
* Essential PH-1
* Pixel 2 XL
* Pixel 3
* iPhone XR
* iPhone 11 Pro Max
* iPhone 12
* OnePlus Nord N1002
* iPhone 14 Pro Max
* iPhone 15 Pro

Phew. Quite the list. Let’s break down some high (and low) lights.

## Best “fun” phone

The OnePlus One was such a great phone to mess around with. Flashing different ROMs, swapping out the backplate, etc.

## Worst phone

This was, without question, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The plastic phone felt cheap, the TouchWiz UI was sluggish and ugly, and the battery was terrible… I used it for a couple of weeks and returned it. This was where I first felt intrigued by “phablet” devices, but it was otherwise a brutal experience.

## Best Android phone

My “panda” Pixel 2 XL was the best Android phone ever, though the Nexus 6 was a close second because of the size and stock Android.

The Pixel 2 XL was a big, sturdy, gorgeous piece of hardware with a smooth, pure Android experience. Using the devices I did, it was as close as I ever felt that Google got to replicating the iPhone experience.

## Best iPhone

This is a really tough call. The iPhone 4 had the best design, but the iPhone 6 Plus stands out because I’d been waiting for a giant iPhone for so long. I never liked the rounded sides of those generations of iPhone, though, so I think the iPhone 12 would be where I’d land. It had a great design and tons of power, and iOS was firing on all cylinders then, too (iOS 14–17).

That said, the iPhone 15 Pro has been great, but I don’t think it would be where it is now if not for the evolution we saw from the 12.

## In closing

Now and then, when I’m at Best Buy or wherever I check out Pixel phones, I am a bit tempted, but I wouldn’t say I like the direction Google’s taken with their Android UI. The performance of those devices has come a long way, but I just can’t see myself wading back into the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN23933B/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google ecosystem</a> at this point. <a href="https://us.nothing.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nothing</a> is doing really cool stuff with their hardware, but, again, anything involving Google or the Play Store at this point is a non-starter.

The iPhone does it all for me. I’m deeply rooted in the Apple ecosystem and happy with what I have there.
