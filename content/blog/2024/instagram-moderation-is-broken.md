> On Tuesday, I loaded Instagram and learned Meta had disabled my account. The alleged reason was that I was under 13, the minimum age for joining the site. It gave me 30 days to appeal before the account was permanently disabled, asking me to upload a copy of my state ID. I decided to trust Meta’s promise it would be “stored securely and deleted within 30 days.” But after review, Meta insisted I was still underage.

I’ve had a similar experience with Instagram lately. My account, roughly a month old, has been deactivated three times. Whenever I appeal, which requires me to upload a selfie to verify... *something*, the account gets reinstated within minutes. The reason for it all? Meta says that my account is related to a seperate account that’s on their shit list.
