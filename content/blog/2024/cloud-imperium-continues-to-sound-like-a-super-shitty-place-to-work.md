A new report has come out claiming that Cloud Imperium Games, the studio that's been working on Star Citizen for over a decade, is mandating several seven day weeks for employees in the lead-up to CitizenCon. This news should not come as a surprise to those who have been following the company. These are the same individuals who have, among other terrible things:

- <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raised over 700 million dollars</a> without shipping anything, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-citizen-refund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resulting in backers taking the company to court for refunds</a>.
- <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-developer-ordered-to-pay-27k-to-disabled-worker-in-return-to-office-discrimination-claim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Denied a disabled employee’s WFH requests and then fired them</a>.
- <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-star-citizen-dev-cig-laid-off-staff-following-studio-relocation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Been accused of having a “highly toxic” culture by a producer</a>.

Who cares how good Star Citizen is, assuming it’s ever finished, when the company making it is *this* rotten?
