> According to internal memos obtained by Insider Gaming, the Manchester (game?) studio have mandated its workers to pull two seven day weeks in the leadup to Citizencon on October 19th.

This news should not come as a surprise to those who have been following the company. These are the same individuals who have, among other terrible things:

- <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raised over 700 million dollars</a> without shipping anything, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-citizen-refund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resulting in backers taking the company to court for refunds</a>.
- <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-developer-ordered-to-pay-27k-to-disabled-worker-in-return-to-office-discrimination-claim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Denied a disabled employee’s requests to work from home and then fired them</a>.
- <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-star-citizen-dev-cig-laid-off-staff-following-studio-relocation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Been accused of having a “highly toxic” workplace culture by a former producer</a>.

Who cares how good Star Citizen is, assuming it’s ever finished, when the company making it is *this* rotten?
