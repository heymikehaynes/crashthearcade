[Justin Carter for Game Developer](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-over-1-million-copies-within-launch-week):

> Konami's PlayStation 5 and PC remake of Silent Hill 2 sold over 1 million copies within days of its launch.

This is great to see. In my time with the game, roughly 10 hours so far, Bloober walks the perfect line between old and new, maintaining the vibe of the original without falling into some traps similar remakes have done.

Maybe this means we'll see a remake of the original?
