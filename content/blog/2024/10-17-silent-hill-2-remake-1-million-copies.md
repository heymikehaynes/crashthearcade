[Justin Carter for Game Developer](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-over-1-million-copies-within-launch-week):

> Konami's PlayStation 5 and PC remake of Silent Hill 2 sold over 1 million copies within days of its launch.

This is great to see. During my time with Silent Hill 2, I've felt that the Bloober team has done an outstanding job preserving the ambience and tension of the original. It's nice to see players invest in the game and appreciate the hard work they've put into it.

Could this mean that we'll see a remake of the first one?
