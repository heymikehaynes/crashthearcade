Earlier this year, I wondered what [a search engine for the indie web](https://crashthearcade.com/blog/2024/the-indieweb-needs-a-search-engine-or-something-like-it/) might look like—but I never circled back to the idea.

Now, I think I've found the answer: Feedle.

Feedle is everything you'd hope for in an indie web-focused search engine. It's small, run by just a couple of people, and features a manual review process for sites. The search functionality is powerful and even provides RSS feeds to follow specific topics in your favourite RSS reader.

The content is a good mix, featuring smaller, personal blogs and more prominent publications supporting the indie web and the fediverse—MacStories being a great example.

Speaking of the fediverse, another great feature is the ability for authors to link their Mastodon accounts. If they choose to, their profile appears alongside their posts, bridging the gap between Feedle and the fediverse.

Feedle has a lot going for it, and it's just getting started.
