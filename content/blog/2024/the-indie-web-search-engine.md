Earlier this year, I wondered what [a search engine for the indie web](https://crashthearcade.com/blog/2024/the-indieweb-needs-a-search-engine-or-something-like-it/) might look like, but I never circled back to the idea.

Now, I think I've found the answer: Feedle.

Feedle is everything you'd hope for in an indie web-focused search engine. It's small, run by just a couple of people, and they actually review sites manually before including them. The search works great and even lets you grab RSS feeds for specific topics.

What makes Feedle really interesting is its mix of content. You'll find everything from personal blogs to more prominent publications like MacStories that have been supportive of the indie web. It's not just another generic search tool; it feels more like a carefully curated space.

One neat feature: authors can link their Mastodon accounts. So, if they want, their profile shows up alongside their posts. It's a clever way of connecting websites with the broader decentralized social web.

Feedle is still getting started, but it's definitely got potential.
