[Marie Dealessandri for GamesIndustry.biz](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/geforce-now-to-establish-100-hour-playtime-limit):

> Nvidia's subscription cloud gaming service GeForce Now will soon be enforcing a playtime limit of 100 hours per month. \[...\] The company said the limit "comfortably accommodates 94% of members." \[...\] Members will also be able to purchase additional hours.

I understand that this change won’t affect most people, but on principle alone, it’s ridiculous. We’re talking about a *trillion-dollar company* here.
