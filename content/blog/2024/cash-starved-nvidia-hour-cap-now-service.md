[Marie Dealessandri for Gamesindustry](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/geforce-now-to-establish-100-hour-playtime-limit):

> Nvidia's subscription cloud gaming service GeForce Now will soon be enforcing a playtime limit of 100 hours per month. [...] The company said the limit "comfortably accommodates 94% of members."

I get that most people won't be effected by this but, on principal alone, this is dumb as hell. This is a *trillion dollar company* we're talking about here.
