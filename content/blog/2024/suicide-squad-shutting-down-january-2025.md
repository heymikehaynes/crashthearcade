Rocksteady confirmed what I think many people assumed: Suicide Squad is **done**. The studio is shutting down the live-service game in January 2025, patching it for offline support and moving on. The announcement downplays the whole thing, but it's important to note how big of a misfire this was from a studio known for *great* games.

Suicide Squad was released on February 2nd, 2024. It will have lasted less than a year before being shuttered. Destiny 1/2 and League of Legends, both titles that Warner pitted Suicide Squad against in the run-up to release, have been running for 10 and 15 years, respectively.

Both Suicide Squad and Concordâ€™s short lifespans should be eye-opening to AAA studios trying to break into the live-service space. The market for these types of games has reached maturity. People have found their games, and you either need to bring something completely new to the table or don't bother showing up.

There are rumours Rocksteady wants to take another swing at a single-player game. You have to wonder if they'll get that chance.
