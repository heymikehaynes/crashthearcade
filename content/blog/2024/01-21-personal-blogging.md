I was admittedly skeptical of 2024 being a return for personal blogging. That said, I’ve been following breadcrumb trails from one blog post to another for the past couple days and finding some of the best stuff I’ve read in *forever*.

It’s starting to remind me of the days on the web when things weren’t built to show you everything you *could read*. Instead, it helped you find something you actually *wanted to read*. It feels early, but we’re making progress.

I’ve shared a few posts related to this that I found insightful recently but here are some others from the last week or so:

- [Build your Neue Internet](https://blog.webb.page/2024-01-16-manifesto.neue.txt)
- [Make a Damn Website](https://lmnt.me/blog/make-a-damn-website.html)
- [Where have all the websites gone?](https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/where-have-all-the-websites-gone/)
- [Your site, your home, your web](https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/your-site-your-home-your-web/)
