[Chasing Static](https://www.igdb.com/games/chasing-static) is pure atmospheric horror, with a sense of unease that big-budget titles often struggle to achieve. While there are minor graphical issues, the gameâ€™s rewarding exploration and puzzles combine with a solid psychological sci-fi narrative to make up for any shortcomings. For fans of classic, PSX horror games, Chasing Static is a must-play.
