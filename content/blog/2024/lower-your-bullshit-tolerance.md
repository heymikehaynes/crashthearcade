I wish we weren't so quick to accept the things we use getting shittier, with higher prices and fewer features. I'm not suggesting boycotts, but it's troubling how we've, myself included, grown numb to decline and do nothing to push back.

Netflix lets its show quality plummet into the abyss, then chooses to crack down on password sharing. What do we do? Shrug, stay subscribed, and pay more.

Disney raises streaming prices without adding anything meaningful for subscribers. We shrug, stay subscribed, and pay more.

Spotify, a platform that *barely* compensates artists, reports record profits while stuffing in podcasts and audiobooks, only to demand a higher monthly fee. Again, we shrug, stay subscribed, and pay more.

On social platforms, the price we pay, usually, is our time. Facebook floods users with lies, conspiracies, and AI-generated garbage, but people scroll on with little protest.

Instagram shows us what *it* wants us to see, not what interests us. TikTok feeds its algorithm to keep us scrolling, endlessly swiping.

And Twitter? It has devolved into a platform that openly tolerates hate and extremism. And yet, users complain, shrug, and keep scrolling.

It's time to raise our standards and lower our bullshit tolerance. Our time and money are too valuable to waste on platforms and companies that give nothing back. These corporations, with their obscene market valuations, don't care about youâ€”they care about profit. They lose power when we stop giving them our attention and money.

Don't settle. Demand better. Or, at the very least, stop shrugging.
