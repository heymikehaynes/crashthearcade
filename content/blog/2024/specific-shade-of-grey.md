Sony’s [30th anniversary celebration](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/30th-anniversary-collection/) of the original PlayStation feels like a letdown. Releasing nostalgic PS1-themed controllers and a reskinned console that doesn’t even play PS1 games seems like a missed opportunity. And yes, they offer the Classic Collection on PS Plus Premium for $23 per month, but that’s a problem for another day.

I’ve got a collection of original PlayStation games like Breath of Fire 4, Silent Hill, and others that don’t work on the PS5. What’s more, I’ve already repurchased some of these games digitally on the PS3, thinking I’d have access to them for the foreseeable future. But no—those didn’t even make it to the PS4.

I get this might sound petty, but that’s the point. I’m over billion-dollar gaming companies flip-flopping on backwards compatibility. They repeatedly charge players for the same games, only to drop support after a few years. It’s no wonder people turn to piracy. If Sony isn’t willing to respect longtime fans and preserve the games that got them to a 30th anniversary in the first place, why should players feel compelled to support Sony by rushing out to buy PS1-themed peripherals?

So, as cool as the idea of a $110 controller in a specific shade of grey with colourful face buttons sounds—I’ll pass; thanks.
