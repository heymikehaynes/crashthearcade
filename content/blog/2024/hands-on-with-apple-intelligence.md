I've spent some time with Apple Intelligence, using version 18.1 for several weeks and now 18.2 for most of yesterday.

## 18\.1

I really appreciate the notification summaries. A few times, just by glancing at my phone, I could instantly see and understand what was waiting in my inbox. It’s not flawless—occasionally, the order of information is off, or it says the opposite of what the message actually contains. However, these issues are rare, and overall, I find it to be a genuinely useful feature.

## 18\.2

The image search via the camera button is particularly impressive. I snapped a picture of my dog, a Corgi-Shepherd mix, and when I asked it to identify the breed, it nailed it. It worked for everything I tried, even pulling up information about the game I was playing based on a picture of my TV. This felt like the first time AI truly seemed *magical* to me. I have no idea how it works in real-life scenarios, but I’m looking forward to trying it more during a work trip I have in early November.

As for the playground features, they’re about as gimmicky as I (and many others) expected. I doubt I’ll use them beyond some initial testing, and fortunately, they can mostly be removed. While there are still image generation features scattered throughout the system, they’re easy enough to ignore.

Overall, as I said during [my initial thoughts](https://crashthearcade.com/blog/2024/06-01-wwdc24-apple-intelligence/) at WWDC, I’m impressed with Apple’s slower approach compared to the more aggressive, desperate, borderline *dangerous* paths taken by Google and Microsoft. Here’s hoping Appl stay the course.
