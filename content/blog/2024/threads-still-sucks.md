Against my better judgment, I decided to give Threads another shot. Unfortunately, it’s only slightly less painful than I remembered—which isn’t much of an improvement. The main “For You” feed is a chaotic mess of generic, uninteresting, and often offensive content. It’s filled with bland, overused questions you’ve seen countless times elsewhere (and often wish you hadn’t). It all feels so fake, just people posting literally *anything* for engagement or ripping off old jokes from Twitter.

One thing Meta *has* managed to change since my last visit is how much harder they’ve made it to access the “Following” feed. They’ve buried it so deeply that the app feels practically unusable. If you want to see content you actually care about, you have to dig through a clunky interface that looks like a half-baked knockoff of Bluesky’s feeds menu. And I genuinely cannot overstate just how terrible the “For You” feed is.

Case in point: the algorithm assumed I’d enjoy a post where some dude asked what the female equivalent of video games is. (For the record, it’s video games, you moron.) The fact that this question even exists is embarrassing enough, but what’s worse is that the comments were full of people treating it like a serious discussion. It’s borderline insulting that Threads assumes this kind of trash is what I’m there for.

After this latest experiment, I can confidently say Threads isn’t for me—and honestly, I’m not sure who it *is* for. The endless stream of engagement bait and the massive effort required to filter out anything worthwhile make it feel like work. Threads, like many other Meta products, isn’t about connection; it’s about keeping you trapped in an endless scroll of nonsense. Hard pass.
