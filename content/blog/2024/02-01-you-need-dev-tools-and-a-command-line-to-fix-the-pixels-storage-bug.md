> Last week, reports surfaced that some Pixel owners were being locked out of their phone’s local storage, creating a nearly useless phone with all sorts of issues. \\\[…\\\] Google’s automatic update system broke people’s devices, but the fix is completely manual, requiring users to download the developer tools, install drivers, change settings, plug in their phones, and delete certain files via a command-line interface.

As someone who spent a considerable amount of time rooting, flashing, and tinkering with Android phones over the years, this is so difficult for the average person to do that I’m stunned it was [suggested](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/256412156/).

Imagine the frenzy if this was Apple.
