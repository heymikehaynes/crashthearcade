> After nearly five years since retiring the imprint, DC Comics has officially announced at NYCC 2024 the highly anticipated return of VERTIGO. This marks a major moment for the publisher, reigniting one of its most iconic imprints known for groundbreaking, mature storytelling.

It's great they're bringing back Vertigo. I think this will help give some definition to Black Label as a place for more mature takes on existing DC characters. And Vertigo as the place for original, dark stories that don't necessarily require people to be fans of superheroes. It could also be a great avenue for new writers to break in with stories that DC might not otherwise have published, even in Black Label.
