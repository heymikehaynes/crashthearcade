If you’re a company considering a design contest where you solicit free work from trained designers for your websites, apps, icons, or logos, stop. It’s insulting to an entire profession and makes me think less of you, your company, and your product.

You wouldn’t call hundreds of electricians to install a light at your house and pay the “winner.” This isn’t any different.

If you’re a designer thinking about spending the time and energy participating in a design contest for a couple hundred bucks or a free year of membership to some service, don’t. Take pride in your craft. Your time and skill are worth more than a cash prize and “exposure.”

It’s 2024. Enough of this nonsense.
