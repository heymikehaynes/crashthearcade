Much has been said of the empty husk masquerading as a new version of the much-beloved Vice site Waypoint, but <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/i-still-dont-understand-why-until-dawn-needed-a-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a> in particular is a perfect encapsulation of why bringing the site back is a bad idea.

The article, written by Dwayne Jenkins about the Until Dawn remake, is framed around the author's fundamental misunderstanding of the game's development. Jenkins speculates on what the remake implies for Supermassive Games' future, but Supermassive didn’t work on the remake, Ballistic Moon did.

I'm not sure if you could draw a clearer parallel to the people who decided to bring the site back in the first place. Executives who have a similar misunderstanding of what made the original site great.
