[Chris Scullion for VGC](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ruiner-studio-reikon-games-has-reportedly-laid-off-around-80-off-its-staff/):

> Kotaku’s sources say that around four out of every five employees at Reikon have been laid off, making for a total of “60 to 70 people”.

This is awful. I *loved* [Ruiner](https://www.igdb.com/games/ruiner). I think it was my GOTY in 2017.

Combined with the dozens of other studios that have made cuts, in 2024 alone, I’ve read that roughly 6–7 thousand people working in the industry have lost their jobs. We’re not even through January, how much worse will it get?

Letting that number sink it, it’s challenging to want to pick up a controller and play anything right now, to be honest.
