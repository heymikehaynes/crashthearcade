> Netflix has shut down its AAA Southern California game studio known as Team Blue. As reported by Game File, Netflix confirmed its fifth internal studio had been closed, and that three hires on the team had left the company.

Netflix's gaming business has never made sense to me and has always seemed like a shiny object for executives and VPs to focus on for a while before moving on to something else. Team Blue being shut down after only a couple of years doesn't help.

I'm regularly seeing people from Netflix Games on LinkedIn promoting positions they're hiring for, which feels dishonest when something like this happens a few days later. It makes it seem like the importance of games at the company is constantly changing, creating an environment that's harmful to employees.

Hoping everyone finds work as soon as possible.
