After only a couple years, Netflix is shutting down their AAA gaming studio run by former Halo, Overwatch, and God of War alums.

Netflix's gaming business has never made sense to me and has always seemed like a shiny object for executives and VPs to focus on for a while before moving on to something else. "Blue" being shut down after only a couple of years doesn't help.

I'm regularly seeing people from Netflix Games on LinkedIn promoting positions they're hiring for, which feels dishonest when something like this happens a few days later. It makes it seem like the importance of games at the company is constantly changing, creating an environment that's harmful to employees.

Hoping everyone finds work as soon as possible.
