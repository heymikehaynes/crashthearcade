After only a few years, Netflix is shutting down its AAA gaming studio, which is run by former Halo, Overwatch, and God of War alums.

Netflix's gaming division has never made sense to me. It's always seemed like less of a business and more of a shiny object for executives and VPs to focus on before moving on to something else. The shutdown of "Blue" after just a couple of years doesn't help.

I regularly see people from Netflix Games on Linkedin promoting positions they're hiring for, which feels dishonest when something like this happens a few days later. It makes it seem like the importance of games at the company is constantly changing, creating an environment that's harmful to employees.
