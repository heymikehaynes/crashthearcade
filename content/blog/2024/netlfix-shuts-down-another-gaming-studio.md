After only a couple of years, Netflix is shutting down its AAA gaming studio, which is run by former Halo, Overwatch, and God of War alums.

Netflix's gaming business has never made sense to me and has always seemed like a shiny object for executives and VPs to focus on before moving on to something else. "Blue" being shut down after only a few years doesn't help.

I regularly see people from Netflix Games on Linkedin promoting positions they're hiring for, which feels dishonest when something like this happens a few days later. It makes it seem like the importance of games at the company is constantly changing, creating an environment that's harmful to employees.
