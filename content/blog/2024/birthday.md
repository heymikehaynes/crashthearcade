My dad's birthday was this week. He would have been 68. He passed away 16 years ago and completely shifted my perspective on life. It was the first time I truly understood how fragile everything is and how important it is not to take things for granted.

He was the strongest person I knew, even in the face of struggles with substance abuse and mental health. Seeing him lying helpless in a hospital bed was jarring, a stark contrast to the strength I had always seen. Since then, I've developed anxiety about my health and habits, which I'm sure is a result of that experience. I've also come to better appreciate the lessons he taught me, whether he realized it or not, which feels even more important now that I'm a dad myself.

His death and the shift in my mindset changed my life in so many ways. I left an unhealthy relationship, quit my job, went back to school, bought a house, and, in a sense, became an adult. I owe the life I have now to him. I wish he were here to see it.

Happy birthday, dad.
