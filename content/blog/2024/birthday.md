My dad's birthday was this week. He would be 68. He passed away 16 years ago, and completely shifted my perspective on life. It was the first time I think I truly understood how fragile everything is and how important it is not to take things for granted.

He was the strongest person I knew, even in the face of struggles with substance abuse and mental health. Seeing him lying helpless in a hospital bed was so jarring, such a stark contrast to that strength. Since his death, I’ve carried anxiety about my own health and habits, but also the lessons he taught me, whether he realized it or not. Things that feel even more important now that I’m a dad myself.

His death and the shift in my mindset changed my life in so many ways. I left an unhealthy relationship, quit my job, went back to school, bought a house, and, in a sense, became an adult. I owe the life I have now to him. I just wish he was here to see it.

Happy birthday, dad.
