> In February 2025, writer Charles Soule and artist Jesús Saíz will team up for a new ongoing series appropriately entitled Eddie Brock: Carnage, in which he serially kills serial killers. Paying his debt to society, and all.

Nothing is certain, except death, taxes, and monthly comics from Marvel starring some version of Carnage.
