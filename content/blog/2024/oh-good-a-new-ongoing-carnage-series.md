> In February 2025, writer Charles Soule and artist Jesús Saíz will team up for a new ongoing series appropriately entitled Eddie Brock: Carnage, in which he serially kills serial killers. Paying his debt to society, and all.

Nothing is certain, except death, taxes, and monthly comics from Marvel starring some version of Carnage. As I've said previously, you will never be able to convince me Carnage is anything more than a dude who got flown into space and ripped in half by the Sentry.
