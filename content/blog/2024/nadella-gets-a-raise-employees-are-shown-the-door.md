[Sophie McEvoy for GamesIndustry.biz](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-ceo-pay-rises-63-to-79-million):

> Microsoft boss Satya Nadella's total pay package increased by 63% this fiscal year, reaching $79.1 million. \[...\] However, Microsoft has been hit with massive waves of layoffs this year with over 2,500 jobs lost.

This is a complete failure of leadership at one of the biggest companies in the world. Guy should be ashamed of himself.
