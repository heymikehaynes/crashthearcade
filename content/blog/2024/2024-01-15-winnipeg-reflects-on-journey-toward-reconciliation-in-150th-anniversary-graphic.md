[Arturo Chang for CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-150-graphic-unveiled-1.7084154?cmp=rss):

> The graphic features multiple symbols representing Winnipeg, including a prairie crocus (the provincial flower), the Red and Assiniboine rivers (which meet in the centre of Winnipeg) and an overlay of the city’s current footprint.

> It’s enclosed by the outline of a turtle shell to represent Turtle Island and has other symbols representing the city’s Indigenous roots. Two footprints represent the path toward reconciliation.

A few things to celebrate here:

- It acknowledges reconciliation and celebrates not only the city but also it’s Indigenous history.
- It was created by an artist from Peguis First Nation.
- It wasn’t the result of an [ill-conceived design contest](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/controversial-canada-150-logo-design-contest-won-by-university-of-waterloo-student/article_14ccd77d-11da-5be8-9c3e-c14c9db5f7a9.html).
- It looks really good.
