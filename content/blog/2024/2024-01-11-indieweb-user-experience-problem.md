So much of the existing infrastructure and tools of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IndieWeb</a> have been built without the input of people dedicated to crafting an experience for a broader range of users. I won’t call out specific services, products, or people; I mean no disrespect, but it’s clear that so many of the available tools are made by developers, for developers.

Suppose people want the independent web to take off and achieve anything close to mass adoption. In that case, more consideration must be given to how non-developers can get started.
