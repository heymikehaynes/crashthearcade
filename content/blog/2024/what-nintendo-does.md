As news broke yesterday about the latest bed Nintendo has decided to shit in, [targeting](https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike) a longtime fan with DMCA strikes for sharing videos featuring their games, I was reminded of a few things.

This kind of hostile behavior is, unfortunately, what we’ve come to expect from Nintendo. Never mind the cute alarm clock or music app—they’re one of the most needlessly customer-hostile companies out there. What’s particularly frustrating, as we've seen countless times in their battles against emulation sites, is that Nintendo themselves don't offer any legal way to play many of the games featured on Crandall’s channel.

Remember the [Nintendo Creators Program](https://kotaku.com/nintendos-youtube-plan-is-already-being-panned-by-youtu-1682527904)? Or the strict, joy-killing [guidelines](https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-shocks-competitive-fans-with-strict-new-community-tournament-guidelines) they’ve slapped onto Super Smash Bros tournaments? Why do we keep cheering them on every time they release something “cute” or nostalgic? Enough is enough already.
