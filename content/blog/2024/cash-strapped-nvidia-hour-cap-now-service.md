I wish we weren't so quick to accept the things we use getting shittier, with higher prices and fewer features. It's troubling how we've, myself included, grown numb to decline in the services we use.

[Marie Dealessandri for GamesIndustry.biz](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/geforce-now-to-establish-100-hour-playtime-limit):

> Nvidia's subscription cloud gaming service GeForce Now will soon be enforcing a playtime limit of 100 hours per month. The new rule won't affect Founder memberships, but will impact the newly renamed Performance and Ultimate tiers, Nvidia announced on Reddit. The company said the limit "comfortably accommodates 94% of members."

I understand that this change won't affect most people, but on principle alone, it's ridiculous. We're talking about a *trillion-dollar company* here.

We need higher standards and a lower tolerance for this bullshit. When companies like Nvidia, again, one of the most valuable in the world, take away features and functionality while rake in record-setting profit, maybe we should reconsider our investment in them.
