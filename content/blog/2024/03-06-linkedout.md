I’ve been spending an uncomfortable amount of time on LinkedIn lately, which is to say more than 5 minutes, and I’ve noticed some things.

* Notifications, which are pretty important in a professional environment, are wildly inconsistent. Someone commented on a post of mine, recommending a role, and I never got a notification about it. Worse yet, it’s very difficult to find your own posts to review those comments manually.
* There are plenty of people contributing to Linkedin’s “Collaborative Articles” that appear around the site and in other’s feeds. They have enough information on you. Adding your hard-earned knowledge freely to the AI they’re building doesn’t seem worth it.
* Everyone is using DALL-E or Midjourney to generate pictures for their stories about tips for success or how to fund your startup. If I had a loonie for every cheesy, “inspirational” photo I’ve seen featuring people with extra fingers, I’d be rich. They look awful and are not helpful. In fact, they’re the opposite.
