The internet has no shortage of opinions, some helpful, some not so much. If you spend too much time worrying about what other people think of the things you do, you’ll end up stuck, second-guessing yourself instead of just doing the thing that brings you joy. Let me save us some time: the opinions of random people online don’t matter. 

Not one bit.

If you’ve got a blog, write in it. If you don’t, make one and start. If posting on Mastodon makes you happy, do that. If Bluesky feels like a better fit, go for it.

You don’t need permission, validation, or even an audience to do what brings you happiness. The people that will tell you otherwise don't know you and aren't in your shoes. Their skepticism isn’t worth your time.

Ignore the noise. Lean into what makes you happy. Just do your thing.
