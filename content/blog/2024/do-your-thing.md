This might sound obvious but it bears repeating.

The internet has no shortage of opinions, some helpful, some not so much. If you spend too much time worrying about what other people think of what you do, you’ll end up stuck, second-guessing yourself instead of actually doing the thing that fills your tank. Let me save us both some time: the opinions of random people online don’t matter.

If you’ve got a blog, write in it. If you don’t, make one and start. If posting on Mastodon makes you happy, do that. If Bluesky feels like a better fit, go for it. You don’t need permission, validation, or even an audience. The people who say otherwise don’t know you, don’t understand you, and don’t get to tell you how you spend your time.

Ignore the noise. Lean in to what makes you happy. Do your thing.
