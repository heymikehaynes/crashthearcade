[Jyolsna for WP Tavern](https://wptavern.com/highlights-from-matt-mullenwegs-spiciest-word-camp-presentation-at-wordcamp-us-2024):

> Mullenweg criticized [WP Engine] for contributing little to the WordPress community’s “Five for the Future” initiative. […] Mullenweg explained that he had attempted to discuss increasing WP Engine’s contributions, but after receiving no positive response, he felt it necessary to call them out publicly.

To have dragged this out into the public eye feels *misguided*. At the same time, after reviewing WP Engine’s website, I understand some of the frustration. Their language feels deceptive and implies that WordPress is a WP Engine product. This couldn’t be further from the truth if the contribution hours are accurate.

Similarly, WordPress.com has always walked a fine line and, depending on the plan, could create an equally degraded user experience. Many confuse WP.com and WP.org, and Automattic claims that WPE is doing the same thing.

There’s a lot of grey here, so neither side feels completely right or wrong, but I feel like Automattic comes out worse for wear. I feel for the people working there who could have done without this noise.
