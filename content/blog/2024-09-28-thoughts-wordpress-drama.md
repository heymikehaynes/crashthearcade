[Jyolsna for WP Tavern](https://wptavern.com/highlights-from-matt-mullenwegs-spiciest-word-camp-presentation-at-wordcamp-us-2024):

> Mullenweg criticized [WP Engine] for contributing little to the WordPress community’s “Five for the Future” initiative. […] Mullenweg explained that he had attempted to discuss increasing WP Engine’s contributions, but after receiving no positive response, he felt it necessary to call them out publicly.

To have dragged this out into the public eye feels *misguided*. At the same time, after reviewing WP Engine’s website, I understand some of the frustration. Their language feels deceptive and implies that WordPress is a WP Engine product. If the contribution hours are to be believed, this couldn’t be further from the truth.

Similarly, WordPress.com has always walked a strange line and could, depending on the plan, create a similarly *degraded* experience for users. There are also plenty of people who confuse WP.com and WP.org, which is essentially what WPE being punished for doing.

There’s a lot of grey here so neither side feels completely right or wrong but I feel like Automattic comes out worse for wear here. I feel for the people working there that could have done without this noise.
