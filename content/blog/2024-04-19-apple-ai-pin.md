Watching reviews for Humane’s AI pin, I can’t help but wonder why someone hasn’t just clipped an Apple Watch to a shirt.

I remember back around 2016, I backed a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1104350651/tiktok-lunatik-multi-touch-watch-kits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kickstarter project</a> that created watchbands for the fourth-generation iPod Nano (I got the “TikTok” if you’re curious), and I loved it. I wore my “iWatch” until the Nano’s battery fried. How hard would it be to make an “unofficial” Apple AI pin?

Look, I know that Siri on the Apple Watch often isn’t anywhere near helpful, but it’s clear that Humane’s version <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/humane-ai-pin-review-roundup-this-is-a-disaster" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t either</a>. So, unless you wanted that low-res neon display for your palm, you can get practically the same experience on something you might already have.

Food for thought.
