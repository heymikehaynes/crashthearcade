[Central Canada Comic Con on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/C4Con/posts/2479265635482533):

> River City Conventions after 25 years will be closing its doors permanently. There will be no future events planned for 2020 or the future.

I wasn’t the biggest fan of the convention but I’m still sad to see it shut down. I had some great experiences there many years ago. Why they couldn’t have scaled back the event and put it on in a different place is beyond me.

While the organizers were quick to blame the venue and sponsors for their troubles in their previous [update](https://mikehaynes.blog/post/3050/), this makes me think they’re withholding details to avoid damaging their reputation with their supporters.

GalaxyCon Minneapolis is in November and the guest [list](https://minneapolis.galaxycon.com/creators/) looks fantastic.
