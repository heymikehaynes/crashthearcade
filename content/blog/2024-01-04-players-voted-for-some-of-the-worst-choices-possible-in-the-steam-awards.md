[Graham Smith for RPS](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/players-voted-for-some-of-the-worst-choices-possible-in-the-steam-awards):

> The player-voted Steam Awards have reached their conclusion, and the results are about as weird as the nominees. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that the weirdest game possible won in several categories, such as Red Dead Redemption 2 for the Labor Of Love award and Starfield for “Most Innovative Gameplay”.

Back in the day, GameFAQs would run polls for the greatest characters in gaming (or something equally ridiculous). The users of the [Something Awful forums](https://forums.somethingawful.com) would, en masse, vote for the characters nobody <s>liked</s> expected, breaking the entire thing and upsetting many teenagers who couldn’t bear to see [Sephiroth](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Sephiroth) lose to [Bub](https://bubblebobble.fandom.com/wiki/Bub) and [Bob](https://bubblebobble.fandom.com/wiki/Bob).

This has that same energy.
