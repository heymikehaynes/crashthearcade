2024 has been off to a weird start. At the end of January, I got let go of my job. I was initially frustrated by the whole ordeal but have come to recognize how destructive it was to my mental health.

## Reading

So far this year, I’ve read 49 different manga and graphic novels, including ones that had been sitting on my shelf for nearly a year. I finished 58 last year, so, needless to say, I should have no trouble clearing that. As an aside, I’ve added reviews to my games and books to better keep track of the stuff I’ve enjoyed.

## Games

I’ve been playing Final Fantasy VII Rebirth for the past few weeks and Persona 3 Reload before that. Both games have been a ton of nostalgic fun. FFVII, in particular, walks this fine line between the familiar and the unknown, for which I commend the team. Even as someone who wasn’t the biggest fan of the original, I find what they did there pretty amazing.

I hope to wrap it up before Dragon’s Dogma 2 drops on the 22nd.

## TPC

I found out <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Tokyo+Police+Club" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tokyo Police Club</a> is breaking up, and that has me bummed out. They’ve been one of my favourite bands for a long time.

## Guestbook

I took a page from Manuel Moreale’s <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/guestbooks-are-cool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(guest)book</a> (<a href="https://kevquirk.com/i-have-a-guestbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kev Quirk’s, too</a>) and built one of my own. If you’re passing through, feel free to leave a message. I appreciate it.

## Shop

Lastly, I built and integrated a Gumroad store into my site to sell stickers. The goal was to prop something up relatively quickly and motivate me to get back into drawing. If you decide to buy a sticker, know that you have my thanks. I’m handling all the shipping personally, so I’ll do my best to get it to you ASAP.

## Wrap-up

Thanks for reading. I’ll try to make these a little more consistent. I had a preconceived idea of what I thought these updates needed to be: long, carefully crafted posts. Giles Turnbull’s <a href="https://doingweeknotes.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doing weeknotes</a> site has convinced me otherwise.

The plan now is simpler, shorter, and more frequent. 🤞🏻
