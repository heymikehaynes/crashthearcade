2024 has been off to a weird start. At the end of January I was let go from my job. I was initially frustrated by the whole ordeal but have come to recognize how destructive it was to my mental health.

## Reading

So far this year, I’ve read 49 different manga and graphic novels, including ones that had been sitting on my shelf for nearly a year. I finished 58 last year so, needless to say, I should have no trouble clearing that. As an aside, I’ve added reviews to my games and books to better keep track of the stuff I’ve enjoyed.

## Games

I’ve been playing Final Fantasy VII Rebirth for the past couple weeks and Persona 3 Reload before that. Both games have been a ton of nostalgic fun. FFVII in particular walks this fine line between the familiar and the unknown that I really commend the team for. Even as someone who wasn’t the biggest fan of the original, it’s pretty amazing what they were able to do there.

I’m hoping to wrap it up before Dragon’s Dogma 2 drops on the 22nd.

## TPC

I found out [Tokyo Police Club](https://www.last.fm/music/Tokyo+Police+Club) is breaking up and that has me bummed out. They’ve been one of my favourite bands for a long time.

## Guestbook

I took a page out of Manuel Moreale’s [(guest)book](https://manuelmoreale.com/guestbooks-are-cool) ([Kev Quirk too](https://kevquirk.com/i-have-a-guestbook)) and built one of <s>my own</s>. If you’re passing through, feel free to leave a message. I appreciate it.

## Shop

Lastly, I built a [Gumroad store](https://crashthearcade00.gumroad.com/) and integrated it into my site to sell stickers. The goal was to prop something up relatively quick and motivate me to get back into drawing. If you decide to buy a sticker, know that you have my thanks and that I’m handling all the shipping personally so I’ll do my best to get it to you ASAP.

## Wrap-up

Thanks for reading. I’ll try to make these a little more consistent. I had a preconceived idea of what I thought these updates needed to be: long, carefully crafted posts. Giles Turnbull’s [Doing weeknotes](https://doingweeknotes.com) site has convinced me otherwise:

> A typical weeknote is a short page of text – perhaps with a few pictures. Often it will be mostly bullet points, often it will include links. Sometimes the format will vary (and it’s fine if it does). Weeknotes can be published and shared in lots of different ways – privately, within the digital walls that surround most organisations these days – or publicly, on the open web.

The plan now is simpler, shorter, and more frequent. 🤞🏻
