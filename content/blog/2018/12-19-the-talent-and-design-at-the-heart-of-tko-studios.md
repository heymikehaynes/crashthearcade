TKO has been fun to follow. I was a little skeptical at first but they’ve been bringing on great talent, the books they’ve shown off so far look beautiful, their pricing model and format availability is completely new, and they’re letting people read the first issues of their books for free on [their site](https://tkopresents.com). It might just be the revolution comics need right now.

I’m going to have to break down and order some of the books soon as an early Christmas present to myself. I really like the look of Sara by Garth Ennis and Steve Epting, and Goodnight Paradise by Joshua Dysart and Alberto Ponticelli.

I also really love the design of TKO. Their logo, typography, on-book corner boxes, merch, etc. It’s simple, easily identifiable, and feels distinctly *comics*.
