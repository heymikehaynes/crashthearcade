DC’s new corner box [designs](https://www.instagram.com/p/BdkjSDghiQF/) are awesome. I had seen them a couple of times but didn’t realize they were official yet. Not only do they look great, they’re incredibly informative, showing if a series is a mini and how many issues it runs for. This is very helpful.
