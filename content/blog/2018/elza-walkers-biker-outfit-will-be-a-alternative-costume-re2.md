[Jenni Lada for Siliconera](http://www.siliconera.com/2018/10/22/see-the-resident-evil-2-claire-elza-walker-costume-in-action/):

> Elza Walker was a Ducati bike rider who attended Raccoon University. She was in the Resident Evil 1.5 build, before being redesigned and turned into Claire Redfield in Resident Evil 2. This costume is a nod to what could have been.

Seeing this brings back a great memory for me.

Years ago, I wrote into Gamepro magazine following the release of Resident Evil 2 when I noticed the Elza character that was show in early early previews didn’t end up in the finished game. To my surprise, they answered my letter in a later issue of the magazine — which I still have in a box somewhere in my office — and explained the whole thing.

While it’s not Elza herself, this is a really cool nod to not only longtime fans of the series but specifically those that have followed Resident Evil 2 back to the very beginning.
