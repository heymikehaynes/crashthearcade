[Shannon Liao for The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18123752/tumblr-adult-content-porn-ban-date-explicit-changes-why-safe-mode):

> Banned content includes photos, videos, and GIFs of human genitalia, female-presenting nipples, and any media involving sex acts, including illustrations.

My longtime Tumblr blog isn’t affected by the [update](https://staff.tumblr.com/post/180758987165/a-better-more-positive-tumblr) to their content guidelines. That said, I find it infuriating that neo-nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups are allowed to remain on their platform as photos of “female-presenting nipples” are being flagged and removed left and right.

Based on how well users are taking the news, they might as well just shut the site down.
