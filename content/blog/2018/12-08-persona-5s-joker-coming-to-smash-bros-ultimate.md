[Chaim Gartenberg for The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18130192/persona-5-joker-super-smash-bros-ultimate-dlc-character):

> Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is almost here, but Nintendo isn’t resting on its laurels. On the eve of the game’s launch the company announced the first of five DLC characters for the fighting game: Joker from Persona 5.

I can’t be the only one wondering why a character from Persona 5 – a game that’s only available on PlayStation – would appear in Smash Bros.

I had initially thought this could be the first step to bringing P5 out on the Switch but it seems like a strange order to do that. Why not announce the port and then offer the new character in Smash to tide fans over?

We’ll just have to wait and see.
