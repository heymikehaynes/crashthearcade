# [Tumblr’s adult content ban means the death of unique blogs that explore sexuality ↦](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18124260/tumblr-porn-ban-sexuality-blogs-unique)

But creators and readers alike don’t believe there’s another website that fosters the same kind of sex-positive spaces that Tumblr has.
