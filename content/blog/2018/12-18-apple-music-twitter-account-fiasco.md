[Gary Ng for iPhone in Canada](https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/apple-music-twitter-android/):

> YouTube tech reviewer Marques Brownlee seems to be the ultimate sleuth when it comes to Twitter, as recently he’s been busting companies for tweeting from competitor devices.
> 
>  Earlier this month, he caught Samsung using Twitter for iPhone, and now he’s apparently busted the Apple Music account for using Twitter for Android.

Apple Music is available in a variety of places including the iPhone, phones that run Android, and even Amazon’s Echo devices. Seeing the Apple Music team tweet from something other than an iPhone doesn’t seem weird to me and especially not embarrassing, which the article suggests.
