Keeping up with DC’s Drowned Earth crossover event was so much harder than it should have been. There’s one supertitled [Justice League / Aquaman](https://www.dccomics.com/comics/drowned-earth-2018/justice-leagueaquaman-drowned-earth-1) and another [Aquaman / Justice League](https://www.dccomics.com/comics/drowned-earth-2018/aquamanjustice-league-drowned-earth-1). One is the first issue, the other is the final issue, and they’re both listed as issue one. Simple, right?
