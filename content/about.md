# About

#### Pixels and code. Also coffee.

I’m Mike, a designer and hobbyist developer with a love for video games, manga, and tech in general. In a past life, I ran a comic book news and review site, which helped me build a strong foundation in web design and WordPress development. I’ve also co-hosted several podcasts and a college radio show focused on comics.

I live in ~~frigid~~ lovely Winnipeg, Canada with my wife, our son, and an assortment of dogs and cats.
