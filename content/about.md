# About

#### Pixels and code. Also coffee.

I’m Mike, a designer and hobbyist developer. I love video games, manga, technology (sometimes), and occasionally dabble in pixel art. In a past life, I ran a comic book news and review site, which helped me build a strong foundation in web design and development. I’ve co-hosted several podcasts as well, including a college radio show covering comic books and pop culture.

I live in ~~frigid~~ lovely Winnipeg, Canada with my wife, our son, and an assortment of dogs and cats.
