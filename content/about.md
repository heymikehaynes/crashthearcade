# About

#### Pixels and code. Also coffee.

I’m Mike, a designer and hobbyist developer who loves video games, manga, and (usually) technology. I ran a comic book news and review site in the past, which helped me build a strong foundation in web design and development. I’ve also co-hosted several podcasts and a college radio show on comics.

I live in ~~frigid~~ lovely Winnipeg, Canada with my wife, our son, and an assortment of dogs and cats.

## Technical

This site is built with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev), served by [Vercel](https://vercel.com), and designed by me. It is set in Decimal, a custom bitmap typeface I made myself, and [Archivo](https://www.omnibus-type.com/fonts/archivo/) by Héctor Gatti and Omnibus-Type.

The code for this site is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/heymikehaynes/crashthearcade).
