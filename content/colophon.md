# Colophon

#### Pixels and code. Also coffee.

I’m Mike, a designer and hobbyist developer with a love for video games, manga, and technology. In a past life, I ran a comic book news and review site, which helped me build a strong foundation in web design and WordPress development. I’ve also co-hosted several podcasts and a college radio show focused on comics.

I live in ~~frigid~~ lovely Winnipeg, Canada with my wife, our son, and an assortment of dogs and cats.

## Technical stuff

This site is happily built with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) and served by [Vercel](https://vercel.com). The theme was designed by me. It is set in [Archivo](https://www.omnibus-type.com/fonts/archivo/) by Héctor Gatti and Omnibus-Type, and [Departure](https://departuremono.com) by Helena Zhang.

The code for this site is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/heymikehaynes/crashthearcade).
