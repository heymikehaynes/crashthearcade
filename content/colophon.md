# About

#### Pixels and code. Also coffee.

I’m Mike, a designer and hobbyist developer with a love for video games, manga, and technology. In a past life, I ran a comic book news and review site, which helped me build a strong foundation in web design and WordPress development. I’ve also co-hosted several podcasts and a college radio show focused on comics.

I live in ~~frigid~~ lovely Winnipeg, Canada with my wife, our son, and an assortment of dogs and cats.

## Under the hood

This site is happily built with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) and served by [Vercel](https://vercel.com). The theme was designed by me. It is set in Archivo by [Omnibus-Type](https://github.com/Omnibus-Type) and Departure by [Helena Zhang](https://www.helenazhang.com/).

The code for this site is also available to review on [GitHub](https://github.com/heymikehaynes/crashthearcade).
