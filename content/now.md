## Books, games, etc
I've finished over [215 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/54484570) (mostly manga) so far this year but started slowing down now that I've run out of stuff to read. I haven't played much recently other than Zenless Zone Zero but I think I'm going to grab the Silent Hill 2 Remake next week. I think I'm excited?

## Post-vacation
I'm still recovering from a recent trip with family to California at the end of September. It was great but exhausting.

## Projects
I'm chipping away at this site to make it a singular place to keep all my notes, posts, and other junk. After trying to get something working with 11ty for a while, I think I've finally turned a corner.
