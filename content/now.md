# Now

#### This page is inspired by Derek Sivers' project, [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about). It was last updated on October 4th, 2024.

* I’m recovering from a recent trip with my family to California at the end of September. It was great but&nbsp;*exhausting*. We visited Disneyland, Universal Studios, and caught a Dodgers game.
* I recently switched my WordPress site back and forth from Ghost to Tumblr and back again before finally settling on Eleventy. I’ve been enjoying learning something new, and the community is excellent.

## Books and video games

I’ve finished over&nbsp;[215 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/54484570)&nbsp;(mostly manga) this year but started slowing down now that I’ve run out of stuff to read. I haven’t played much recently besides Zenless Zone Zero, so I’ll grab Silent Hill 2 next week. I never finished the original game but enjoyed the Resident Evil remakes, which many are comparing it to. I’m excited.
