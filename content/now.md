# Now

#### What I've been up to as of October 28th, 2024. This page is inspired by Derek Sivers' project, [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about).

* I recently switched my WordPress site back and forth from Ghost to Tumblr and back again before finally settling on Eleventy. I’ve been enjoying learning something new, and the community is excellent.
* ~~At the beginning of November, I'm heading to Vancouver for a work related trip. I don't typically travel well so we'll see how that goes but I am excited to meet up with my team for the first time.~~

## Books and video games

I’ve finished over ~~150~~ [230 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/54484570) (mostly manga) this year but started slowing down now that I’ve run out of stuff to read. I haven’t played much recently besides Zenless Zone Zero, so ~~I’ll grab Silent Hill 2 next week~~ (Done!). I never finished the original game but enjoyed the Resident Evil remakes, which many are comparing it to. I’m excited.
