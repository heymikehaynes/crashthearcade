# Right now

#### What I've been up to as of November 9th, 2024. This page is inspired by Derek Sivers' project, [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about).

* I recently spent a week in Vancouver for a work trip. It was my first time visiting the city, and I loved it. Staying in the downtown area was a treat—having everything within walking distance made exploring easy and enjoyable. Meeting my teammates in person after six months of remote work was the highlight for sure.
* After some back-and-forth between Ghost, Tumblr, and WordPress, I finally transitioned my site to Eleventy. It’s been fun diving into something new, and the supportive community has made the learning curve feel a lot more manageable.

## Books and video games

I’ve finished over ~~150~~ [230 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/54484570) (mostly manga) this year but started slowing down now that I’ve run out of stuff to read. I haven’t played much recently besides Zenless Zone Zero, so ~~I’ll grab Silent Hill 2 next week~~ (Done!). I never finished the original game but enjoyed the Resident Evil remakes, which many are comparing it to. I’m excited.
