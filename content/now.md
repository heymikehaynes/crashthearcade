# Now

#### This page is inspired by Derek Sivers' project, [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about). It was last updated on October 4th, 2024.

## Life
I'm still recovering from a recent trip with my family to California at the end of September. It was great but *exhausting*.

## Books, games, etc
I've finished over [215 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/54484570) (mostly manga) so far this year but started slowing down now that I've run out of stuff to read. I haven't played much recently other than Zenless Zone Zero so I'm going to grab Silent Hill 2 next week. I never finished the original but I think I'm excited?

## Misc projects
I don't have a ton on the go but I'm turning this site into my new project car to keep me busy. I want to make a singular place to keep and share all my posts, bookmarks, notes, etc and I think this could work. I'm excited to be learning something new by switching to 11ty.
