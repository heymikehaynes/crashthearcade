# Now

#### This page is inspired by Derek Sivers' project, [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about). It was last updated on October 4th, 2024.

- I’m recovering from a recent trip with my family to California at the end of September. It was great but *exhausting*. We visited Disneyland and Universal Studios and caught a Dodgers game.
- I recently switched my WordPress site back and forth from Ghost to Tumblr and back again before finally settling on Eleventy. I’ve been enjoying learning something new.
- I’m excited for the MLB playoffs to start this weekend.

## Books and video games
I’ve finished over [215 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/54484570) (mostly manga) this year but started slowing down now that I’ve run out of stuff to read. I haven’t played much recently besides Zenless Zone Zero, so I’ll grab Silent Hill 2 next week. I never finished the original game but enjoyed the Resident Evil remakes, which many are comparing it to. I’m excited.

## Miscellaneous projects
I’d spent the better part of a year convincing myself I was done with website tinkering, but here we are. I need a singular place to keep and share all my posts, bookmarks, notes, etc. I also hope to get back into pixel art sooner rather than later.
